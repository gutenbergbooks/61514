<h1>CAPTAIN SPARKLE, PIRATE.</h1>

<h2>CHAPTER I.<br />
<span class="smaller">CAPTAIN SPARKLE, THE PIRATE CHIEF.</span></h2>

<p>“Mr. Maxwell Kane!”</p>

<p>The announcement was made by Nick Carter’s valet,
Joseph, who threw open the door of his master’s study
with a gesture as nearly approaching a flourish as any
in which he ever permitted himself to indulge. Joseph
had a wholesome respect for millionaires, and many a
one of them came at one time and another to the detective
for consultation; but it was rarely that Joseph
admitted such a one as Maxwell Kane.</p>

<p>It was a name which was an open sesame at all
doors, however exclusive; it was the name of a man
who counted his millions by hundreds—of a man who,
notwithstanding his great wealth, still found time to be
a good fellow; of an athlete, a sportsman—in short, and
in a word, a gentleman.</p>

<p>It was also the name of a man whom Nick Carter
counted among his personal and intimate friends; but
Joseph was not aware of that fact when he threw open
the door and announced the caller. He had taken the
card to his master a moment before, in his study, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
had been directed to “show the gentleman here, Joseph”;
and Joseph knew that only persons who were privileged,
indeed, were ever permitted to penetrate to Nick Carter’s
study.</p>

<p>Nick wore his house-coat, a short smoking-jacket, and
had been engaged in consuming his after-breakfast cigar
while he read the papers, when the caller was announced.</p>

<p>“Hello, Nick!” was the greeting he received from
Kane. “I got up before breakfast this morning; as you
will observe. What time is it, anyhow?” he added, as
he dropped into a chair which the detective indicated
to him, and pulled out his watch. “Not yet eight o’clock,
eh? Have you had your breakfast?”</p>

<p>“An hour ago,” replied the detective.</p>

<p>“Have you got anything doing to-day?”</p>

<p>“No; I was just congratulating myself that I had not.
All my assistants are out, however, so I can hardly call
myself care free. I never am, you know.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know. Say, old chap, the <i>Goalong</i>”—he referred
to his palatial steam-yacht—“is lying at the dock,
over at the foot of West Twenty-third Street, waiting
for us, and I want you to go aboard with me. Will
you?”</p>

<p>“I’d like to do so, Kane,” replied the detective; “but
there are several things here to which I ought to give
my attention to-day, now that I have a few moments at
my disposal in which to do so. You see——”</p>

<p>“Hold on, Nick. I haven’t finished yet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, go ahead, then.”</p>

<p>“This is a business proposition I’m making. I was
boarded by pirates last night, and I want you to see if
you can’t catch them.”</p>

<p>“Boarded by—what?”</p>

<p>“Pirates—p-i-r-a-t-e-s—pirates. The real thing, too.
Honest Injun, Nick! Did you ever read Cooper’s ‘Red
Rover’? Well, I could take my oath that he has risen
from the bottom of the sea and resumed business at the
old stand. I hope to goodness he won’t hear me; he
might think I am joking, and I was never more in dead
earnest in my life.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that the <i>Goalong</i> was boarded by pirates—really?”</p>

<p>“Do I mean it! Huh! Can’t you see that I’ve lost
flesh? It takes a pretty good-sized man, with a mighty
big proposition on his side of the question, to scare me,
Nick, as you are aware; but that pirate chap did the
act, without a hitch. I haven’t got over it yet.”</p>

<p>“You aren’t trying one of your jokes on me, are you,
Kane?”</p>

<p>“No—on my honor, no!”</p>

<p>“Tell me all about it.”</p>

<p>“Not here, old man. Come aboard the yacht. I’d
rather tell you there. You see, that is what I have
come here for. When this thing happened, I said to
my wife and her sister—they are aboard the <i>Goalong</i>
with me, you know—I told them that there was only
one thing for us to do, and that was to hurry to the
city and find you; and so, if you don’t mind—and you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
have just admitted that you can spare the time—I’ll
take you aboard with me now, and you can hear the
story there, all at once. I won’t affront you by offering
you anything for your services; but, all the same, if it
were a question of bidding against another client in
order to secure you to-day, I’d outbid Standard Oil.
Can I put it any stronger than that, Nick?”</p>

<p>“Not very well.”</p>

<p>“And you’ll come, eh—for friendship’s sake?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I’ll be with you in a moment. Wait here.”</p>

<p>The detective left the room, but presently he returned,
ready for the street, and, without more delay, the two
friends left the house together.</p>

<p>“I came across in a car,” said Kane. “You don’t
mind, do you?”</p>

<p>They boarded a west-bound Twenty-third Street car,
and in a very short time were aboard the sumptuous
yacht, which had been waiting to receive them.</p>

<p>As soon as their feet were pressed upon the deck, the
plank was drawn in, and the lines cast off, and they
had not advanced to the awning under which Kane’s
wife and two guests were seated while awaiting them,
before the yacht was backing out into the river.</p>

<p>“I found him, as you see,” said Kane, advancing rapidly.
“Caught him alone, too, and with nothing to do.
Think of that! Carter, have you ever met my wife’s
sister? Here she is. Miss Bessie Harlan. If I hadn’t
asked my wife to marry me before I met her sister, it
would have been a toss-up between them. Now, I
couldn’t pay Bessie a greater compliment than that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
could I? And this is Count Jean de Cadillac. I made
the count’s acquaintance in Paris last winter. We were
quite chummy there, and when he showed up over here,
a couple of weeks ago——”</p>

<p>“We became even chummier,” interrupted the count,
with a smile, speaking in perfect English, and smiling
so that he showed his perfect, white teeth.</p>

<p>He was a handsome man, too, this Count Cadillac,
with his shining, black eyes, blacker mustache and imperial,
gleaming teeth, and clear, white skin. And his
manners were faultless, his dress perfect without being
foppish.</p>

<p>Nick greeted Mrs. Kane, and acknowledged the introductions
while the yacht was backing into the river;
and then, turning to Kane, while he accepted one of
the deck-chairs, he remarked:</p>

<p>“Now, Max, give us the pirate story.”</p>

<p>“You will understand, before I finish,” said Kane,
“why I insisted upon your coming here before I told
it. I wanted witnesses to support my statements, for
I have an idea that you wouldn’t believe my unsupported
word about this affair.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes——”</p>

<p>“Wait. You haven’t heard the story yet. It’s really
the most incredible thing you ever heard of, from beginning
to end. I’ll give you my word that I wouldn’t
believe a word of it if I hadn’t seen it with my own
eyes.”</p>

<p>“It begins promisingly,” said Nick.</p>

<p>“You wait. We left Newport yesterday, about noon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
I think; between noon and one o’clock. We loafed along,
for nobody was in a hurry, and last night, late in the
evening, we ran in at the American Yacht Club anchorage—you
know where that is, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“We ran in there, and anchored for the night.”</p>

<p>“We were intending to go ashore to call upon some
friends who live near there,” said Mrs. Kane; “but we
found that it was too late when we arrived, so we gave
it up.”</p>

<p>“It was a beautiful night,” continued Kane, “warm,
and as nearly perfect as it could be made; and we sat
out here on the deck until almost one o’clock before
anybody thought of turning in. You see, Carter, it happened
that we were alone at the anchorage. I don’t
suppose that thing would happen once again in a dozen
summers, but it happened last night, all right.”</p>

<p>“I liked it,” said Bessie Harlan. “It was a change.”</p>

<p>“Well,” continued Kane, “the Sound was as smooth
as glass. There wasn’t a ripple anywhere, and——”</p>

<p>“And the moon was just heavenly!” interrupted Bessie,
again; but Kane did not even turn his eyes in her
direction.</p>

<p>“I came back on deck after the others turned in,” he
continued. “I wasn’t sleepy, the night was beautiful,
and I wanted to smoke another cigar, all by my little lonesome.
So I sat here—right where I am seated now—lighted
my cigar, and smoked.</p>

<p>“I am going to take you right back to that anchorage,
Carter, so that you can see things just as they are, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
far as the surroundings are concerned. We are headed
for there now.”</p>

<p>“That is a good idea,” said Nick.</p>

<p>“Well, my cigar was something more than half-smoked,
and, as I am a slow smoker, it must have been something
like half an hour after I was alone before anything
happened; and then it all happened so suddenly that it
was on me before I knew it.”</p>

<p>“What was?” asked the detective.</p>

<p>“The pirate. Wait.”</p>

<p>“I’m waiting.”</p>

<p>“The fellow made his approach from behind, which
would account for my not seeing him or his craft until
he was right there, on the deck, so to speak, but I don’t
think that would account for my not hearing him, do
you?”</p>

<p>“You might have been dozing in your chair,” suggested
Nick.</p>

<p>“Bosh! I was never wider awake in my life!”</p>

<p>“You were, doubtless, so absorbed in what you were
thinking about that you paid no attention to your surroundings.”</p>

<p>“That’s all bosh, too. I was just as alert as I ever
am. As I always am; and I’m not generally known as a
sleeper, or a dreamer, either.”</p>

<p>“That’s quite true, Kane.”</p>

<p>“I was just as wide-awake as I am now. I was just
as much on the alert as I am now. The night was so
still, and the yacht and everything aboard of her was
so silent, that I could have heard a tack drop, the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
length of the <i>Goalong</i>. But the fact remains, all the
same, that I did not hear a sound.</p>

<p>“I was seated right here, in this position and in this
same chair, looking off, as you observe, almost astern.
The bow of the yacht was pointed toward the open
Sound, for the tide was coming in.</p>

<p>“My cigar was on the last quarter—I told you that
once already; but never mind—and I had about made
up my mind to light a fresh one, when I discovered that
I hadn’t another one in my pocket, and would have to
go below to get it. That settled it. If I had felt any
doubt about smoking another cigar, the discovery of the
fact that I had not another one in my possession made
me want nothing on earth so much as that cigar. So
I rose to go below.</p>

<p>“You will observe, from my present position, that I
was obliged to turn in order to do so.</p>

<p>“The companionway is behind me.”</p>

<p>“I got up, stretched myself, chucked my two-thirds-smoked
cigar into the water, and turned——”</p>

<p>He paused, as if to give emphasis to the concluding
statement; and, after a moment of silence, the detective
said:</p>

<p>“Well, what then?”</p>

<p>“The pirate stood directly in front of me.”</p>

<p>“On the deck of your own yacht—of this yacht?”</p>

<p>“Exactly. Right there—on that spot,” and Kane
pointed with his finger toward a point on the deck
directly in front of him, for he had risen while he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
speaking, in order to act out this dramatic incident of
his story.</p>

<p>“Was he alone?” asked Nick.</p>

<p>“No; there were six others directly behind him.”</p>

<p>“Six others!” exclaimed the detective. “Do you mean
to tell me that seven men had succeeded in coming
aboard your yacht, in the bright moonlight, when the
Sound was as smooth as glass and the night was as
still as a church, without rousing you, although you sat
there on the deck smoking?”</p>

<p>“That is exactly what they did do.”</p>

<p>“How did they get aboard?”</p>

<p>“To answer that question now is to get ahead of my
story,” said Kane. “I would rather tell you about it
just as it happened, incident for incident.”</p>

<p>“All right. Go ahead.”</p>

<p>“You could have knocked me out with a crow’s feather
when I discovered them,” continued Kane. “I hadn’t a
leg left to stand on, Carter. I opened my mouth to speak—I
haven’t the least idea what I intended to say, though—when
the chief pirate raised one hand and touched
his fingers to his lips.”</p>

<p>“Which you construed as a command for you to remain
silent?”</p>

<p>“I think that gesture is so construed all over the world,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Quite so. Well, what next?”</p>

<p>“You see, Carter, I knew by their appearance that they
were robbers. It did strike me for an instant that the
whole thing was some huge joke which somebody had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
put up on me, but I was quickly undeceived on that
point.”</p>

<p>“What was their appearance?”</p>

<p>“Here is where I am going to test your credulity, old
man. But my wife and my friends can testify that I tell
you the truth.”</p>

<p>“So they saw the pirates, also?”</p>

<p>“Yes, as you shall hear.”</p>

<p>“Well, about their appearance, or how they appeared,
eh? That part of the comedy seemed to impress you.”</p>

<p>“It did. And it was no comedy, either, I’ll beg you
to understand! Carter, the pirate chief was dressed in
red, from head to feet, and he looked as if he might
have stepped down out of a Shakespeare tragedy, as
far as the cut of his costume was concerned. I think
if you were to dress <i>Romeo</i> in red, you would about
get the proper idea. Eh, count? What do you say?”</p>

<p>“I think you have given a very good description,”
replied the count.</p>

<p>“And the other six?” asked Nick. “Were they dressed
the same?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed! They were only common truck alongside
of their master, I suppose. At all events, they
appeared in ordinary black. Every man jack of them
wore a half-mask over his features. The chief’s mask
was red, like his costume; those of the men were black,
the same as their costumes. They also wore rather
tight-fitting caps on their heads, but the chief wore a
regular Romeo hat, with an eagle’s feather stuck in it.”</p>

<p>“H’m!” said Nick. “It makes quite a picture.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’d have thought so if you had been in my place,
Carter! I didn’t know whether I was scared, amused,
angry, or bored; and I didn’t have time to analyze my
sentiments, either, for when the chief touched his lips
with his fingers, to signal me that he preferred that I
should keep quiet, he remarked, quite calmly and in a
perfectly natural tone:</p>

<p>“‘I don’t suppose you wish needlessly to frighten the
ladies, do you?’</p>

<p>“‘Well, no,’ I replied, ‘I can’t say that I do. They
have retired, however, and we need not disturb them.’</p>

<p>“‘On the contrary, my friend,’ he said, ‘it will be
necessary that they are disturbed. But I am fond of
the ladies. I do not like to frighten them—needlessly.
Then, again, sometimes they faint away, or scream,
and that offends me.’</p>

<p>“‘Indeed?’ I said. ‘Have I by mistake been smoking
on the deck of your yacht, instead of my own?’ I
intended that for sarcasm, Nick, but it fell flat. He
didn’t see the point at all, for he replied, calmly, that
I would find things much more to my taste for a few
moments if I would take that view of it. ‘You may
consider the <i>Goalong</i> as my property for the next half-hour,’
he said.”</p>

<p>“Were they armed?” asked Nick.</p>

<p>“The pirate said they were, and I have no doubt that
they were, although I saw no sign of weapons of any
kind, save that the chief wore a short, straight sword
at his side, and while he talked to me he let his hand
rest upon it, as if to call my attention to the fact.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>“What happened next?”</p>

<p>“Well, when he said that I could look upon my yacht
as his property for the next half-hour or so, I didn’t
seem to have any fitting argument with which to reply
to him, so I remained silent. His next question was
rather more to the point.”</p>

<p>“What was it?”</p>

<p>“He asked me, plainly, how much money I happened
to have aboard the yacht; and he added: ‘If you tell
the truth about it, it will save both of us considerable
trouble.’</p>

<p>“‘Oh, I suppose there are a couple of thousand dollars
here, all told,’ I answered him.</p>

<p>“‘Very good,’ he said. ‘There is also some thousands
of dollars’ worth of silverware, and goldware, isn’t
there?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ I admitted.</p>

<p>“‘And some very valuable cups, which you have won
as trophies, from time to time, eh?’</p>

<p>“‘Why, yes, of course. But you wouldn’t be so low
down as to take them, would you?’ I demanded.</p>

<p>“He laughed at that, as if he considered it a good
joke; and he replied that he thought that part of the
matter might be arranged satisfactorily. I didn’t see
it, but I supposed he did, and the sequel proved that
he did, too.”</p>

<p>“I am waiting for the sequel. What happened next?”</p>

<p>“He said to me: ‘Mr. Kane, you will oblige me by
considering that, for the moment, I am master of this
yacht, and you will, therefore, obey such orders as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
give you. You need not look forward in the hope that
any of your crew is astir, for they are all asleep below,
save one, who was on watch, and he is now lying,
bound and gagged, in the bow.’</p>

<p>“‘All right,’ I said. ‘What are your orders, Mr.
Rover? You seem to have the drop on me, and I’ll
take my medicine with a smile. Speak up. Don’t be
bashful.’</p>

<p>“‘I have already informed you,’ he replied, without
taking any notice of my facetiousness, ‘that it would
be a pity to frighten the ladies. It is, however, necessary
that they should be called to the deck, as I care
as little to affront them as I do to frighten them.’</p>

<p>“‘Why not leave them where they are, then?’ I
asked.</p>

<p>“‘Because it is necessary to make a somewhat thorough
search of their sleeping quarters. I have come
here to obtain their valuables, as well as your own,’
he continued, ‘and it would be decidedly ungentlemanly
for me to do so without first having them called away.’”</p>

<p>“That was real considerate of him, don’t you think
so, Mr. Carter?” asked Mrs. Kane.</p>

<p>“Why, yes. But how did he carry out the idea?”</p>

<p>“He merely ordered me to go below and call them.
He directed me to tell them that a party of gentlemen
had called unexpectedly, and that I insisted upon their
coming on deck at once, in order that they might meet
with a great surprise, and that they were to promise
me that they would not be frightened, no matter what
they saw.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘That,’ he assured me, ‘will arouse their curiosity,
so that they will not consider it a bore to dress themselves
again, and do as you ask.’ You see, he knows
something about women, that chap.”</p>

<p>“Did he go below again?” asked the detective.</p>

<p>“Nay, nay—not on your life! The pirate stuck close
beside me all the while, and he held that naked, flat
sword in his hand, too. I didn’t like the looks of it
a little bit.”</p>

<p>“So you called your wife and her sister, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes; and the count.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t they protest?”</p>

<p>“Protest! I should say so! My wife flatly refused
to come, at first; and she wouldn’t have come, either,
if I hadn’t told her that the whole blooming push would
come down there and pull her out, willy-nilly, if she
didn’t obey. Bessie didn’t raise a kick. She thought
there was some fun on hand, and she is always ripe
for that sort of thing. The count swore like a——”</p>

<p>“Now it is my turn to protest, Kane,” said the count.</p>

<p>“Well, I heard you, and it did me good, for I wanted
to do a little swearing myself. I have never felt quite
so small in my life as I did just then.</p>

<p>“Well, Nick, after I did the calling, we returned to
the deck. The pirate’s followers had not moved from
their position in line, and they didn’t until the chief
waved his hand, and then they fell apart into groups,
for all the world as if they were a lot of guests whom
I had invited to the yacht. But he didn’t join them—not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
he. Instead, he dropped into that chair where the
count is seated, and said coolly:</p>

<p>“‘Mr. Kane, I am Captain Sparkle. When your
guests come on deck, I will thank you to present me
to them.’”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE MYSTERY OF THE PIRATE CRAFT.</span></h2>

<p>“Let me talk, now!” exclaimed Bessie. “I was the
first one to reach the deck after you called us, Max.”</p>

<p>“All right. I’ve no objections. I feel like seven different
kinds of a jay, anyhow, when I tell this story;
and, by the great boot in Chatham Street, Nick, I’d
willingly give up a million rather than go through with
it again! All the same, I want those race cups back
again, if I can get them.”</p>

<p>“So the pirate took them, did he? I thought he said
it might be arranged so that you could keep them?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he took them, all right; and he did offer to
make an arrangement; but I will tell you all about that
when Bessie gets through.”</p>

<p>Nick turned so that he faced Miss Harlan.</p>

<p>“I was the first one to reach the deck,” she began,
“and I saw a distinguished-looking man seated in that
chair where the count is sitting. He wore a red mask
over his face, as Max has described it, and his costume
was strikingly like a Romeo get-up, only it was red.
My first thought was that some of Max’s friends had
discovered that we were at the anchorage, and had come
aboard to treat us to an impromptu fancy-dress party.
I really supposed that I would have known them, had
they not been masked, and regarded the whole thing as
a joke, so I went toward them, humming ‘Gaily the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Troubadour.’ But when I drew nearer, so that I could
get a view of Max’s face, I was startled; he looked
so savage, and he was chewing away at his mustache,
just as if he had not spent hours and hours in training
it ever since it sprouted.”</p>

<p>“That will do, Bessie. Just keep to your story, if
you don’t mind,” said Kane.</p>

<p>“Well,” she continued, “I saw then that something
was the matter. My first thought was that Max was
annoyed because his friends had come; but when he
rose in his place, and, in an icy tone, said: ‘Miss Harlan,
I am compelled, much against my will, to introduce
a gentleman thief to you,’ I didn’t know what to say,
or think. But before I could do either, the pirate had
turned toward Max, and I could see the flash of his
eyes through the holes in his mask, while he said icily:</p>

<p>“‘Mr. Kane, if I hear a repetition of your present
offense, the consequences to yourself and your ladies
will be upon your own head! I beg that you will present
me properly, sir!’</p>

<p>“I was nonplused, Mr. Carter, and I could see that
Max was swearing mad. However, he did as he was
told.</p>

<p>“‘This is Captain Sparkle, a pirate,’ he said. And
then he called out to my sister, who was just appearing,
to go back and get his box of cigars for him.</p>

<p>“I turned to the pirate then, and said: ‘You have
selected a late hour to make your call upon us, Captain
Sparkle.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘From necessity, believe me, madam,’ he replied,
bowing.</p>

<p>“My sister and the count appeared at that moment,
and Max introduced them by saying, between his teeth:</p>

<p>“‘My wife, and Count Cadillac—Captain Sparkle.’
Cora had brought the cigars with her, and Max lighted
one of them. After that he seemed better.”</p>

<p>“And had you not guessed the true significance of
the presence of the man in red?” asked Nick.</p>

<p>“No; I saw that something was wrong, but what it
was or what it all meant, I had no idea. The pirate,
however, did not leave me long in doubt.”</p>

<p>“No? What did he say, and do?”</p>

<p>“Let me speak, now,” interjected Kane’s wife.</p>

<p>“By Jove!” muttered Kane. “One would think this
was a prize composition tourney!”</p>

<p>“My first impression about the matter,” said Mrs.
Kane, “was much the same as Bessie’s. And I suppose
the count’s was the same.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the count. “Quite so.”</p>

<p>“However,” she continued, “as Bessie says, we were
not long left in doubt. Captain Sparkle, as he called
himself, snapped his fingers, and his men, whom I had
noticed when I came out of the cabin, came forward—or,
rather, aft—at once, falling into line like trained
soldiers.</p>

<p>“‘Ladies and gentlemen,’ said Captain Sparkle, then,
‘these are my followers. We have come here on an
important errand. We are, in a word, collecting jewels,
trinkets, money, and valuables of all kinds. In your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
own world you would designate us as robbers, or, perhaps,
by the term which Mr. Kane has just now applied
to me—pirates. I am about to send several of
my men below to obtain what you have there, and you
will each spare yourself unnecessary annoyance resulting
from broken locks and rumpled wearing apparel,
if you will produce your keys, and give me such directions
as will aid us in our search.’</p>

<p>“It was quite a speech, Mr. Carter, and I think I
have repeated it word for word. I was amazed. I
did not know what to think. I was frightened, too;
and then, for the first time, I saw that my husband was
almost beside himself with rage and chagrin. I knew
then that the strangely attired man had spoken the truth,
and that they were robbers.</p>

<p>“I thought Bessie would faint.</p>

<p>“She uttered a cry, and came closer to me; and that
act of hers led the pirate to make another speech.</p>

<p>“‘I beg, ladies,’ he said, ‘that you will not be needlessly
alarmed. You are in no personal danger. You
will not be molested in any way. You have only to
remain seated here in the chairs until we have finished
our business, when we will depart, as we came, in silence.
And in the meantime I will direct one of my
men to act as steward, and to bring wine to you. Now,
if you please, the keys and the information I requested.’”</p>

<p>“Now wait, Cora,” said Kane. “It is my turn again.”</p>

<p>“Go on,” said Nick.</p>

<p>“The pirate left three of his men on deck to watch
us while he took the others below with him. Of course,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
that was after we had given up our keys, and all the
information he asked for about our valuables.</p>

<p>“The men he left to guard us were armed, too, this
time. They each held a revolver. I don’t know where
they got them, for I had not seen them before. Not
one of them uttered a word, however. They simply
stood there, with their pistols in their hands, like so
many wax figures. The count spoke to them two or
three times, but he got no reply at all.</p>

<p>“After a few minutes, one of the men who had gone
below with the chief came back with a tray. The scoundrel
had opened the steward’s pantry and helped himself;
but he sent up a bottle of sherry, a bottle of
whisky, and a siphon of seltzer.”</p>

<p>“But he did not come himself, eh?” asked Nick.</p>

<p>“Not until he was through below. Then he appeared.
But in the meantime his men had come up,
two by two, carrying stuff they had stolen; but they
covered everything with blankets or table linen, so I
could not see a thing they were taking away.</p>

<p>“Once, when two of them were carrying a particularly
heavy bundle toward the bow of the yacht, I half-rose
from my chair, to observe them more closely; but
it was only to find that one of the rascals on guard
over me had thrust the muzzle of his revolver under
my nose, so I resumed my seat without a word.</p>

<p>“Well, after awhile, Carter, the pirate got all he
could find, and he came on deck himself. He came at
once to where I was sitting, and said:</p>

<p>“‘Now, Mr. Kane, about that money, if you please.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Where is it? I have discovered considerably less than
the sum you were good enough to mention.’</p>

<p>“‘You haven’t discovered any that I mentioned,’ I replied
to him.</p>

<p>“‘So I supposed. I will ask you to produce what you
have about you.’</p>

<p>“But he did not take my watch, my cuff-buttons, or
my stickpin, and, although he relieved the count of his
money, he left him his watch and other things.</p>

<p>“And there was an odd thing about it all, too, Carter.
He did not touch with his own hands a thing we offered
him. One of his men stepped forward in each instance,
to accept our offerings.</p>

<p>“But, after it was all over, after he had returned the
keys, and thanked each one of us for the use of them,
the strangest thing of the whole proceeding took place.</p>

<p>“You asked me, when we began, how the fellow got
aboard, and I told you that, to reply to that question,
would be to get ahead of my story.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the detective.</p>

<p>“Well, until that moment, I myself had no idea how
he had accomplished it. I am not positive, even, that
I had asked myself the question. So many things had
happened in such a short time, and my mind had been
kept so employed in thinking about the absurdity of
the whole occurrence, that the mere incident of how
the pirate came aboard my yacht, or how he intended
to take his departure, when the moment arrived to do
so, did not present itself.”</p>

<p>“I can readily understand that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>“But I was soon to discover.</p>

<p>“He returned the keys, and thanked us for our courtesy
with the air of a Chesterfield. Then, with a bow,
which would have made Beau Brummel stare with envy,
he turned his back and walked to the bow of the yacht.</p>

<p>“Mind you, there had not been a sound during the
entire proceeding which would have called a single
member of my crew to the deck, even had they all
been awake and listening, and to this moment, with the
exception of the one man who was captured by the pirates
and bound and gagged near the forecastle-hatch,
not a man of my crew is aware of what happened.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that you have managed to keep it a
secret from all of them?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do mean that. It is bad enough to have the
members of my own family know about it—it is bad
enough to be compelled to tell you about it—without
living to the end of my days knowing that my men are
quietly laughing in their sleeves at me.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid that you are oversensitive about it,
Kane.”</p>

<p>“Humph! Perhaps so; but I don’t like to be laughed
at. And, more, I am not one who is supposed to submit
to such a proceeding without offering the slightest
resistance.”</p>

<p>“I know that.”</p>

<p>“And here I permitted that fellow to come aboard,
to take me by surprise, to compel me to call my wife
and my guests to the deck, to give up my keys and
my money to him, and to do a hundred different things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
to assist him in his robbery, and all that without one
word of protest, and without offering the slightest resistance;
but I said that before.”</p>

<p>“He had the drop on you, Kane.”</p>

<p>“Had the drop on me? I should say he did! He
had the drop on me, and he had the sand all out of
me, as well! That is what makes me so mad whenever
I think about it.”</p>

<p>“Well, about his manner of coming aboard and leaving
the yacht. You started to tell me about that?”</p>

<p>“When the pirate left us to walk forward, I noticed
for the first time that there was a craft of some kind
lying across our bow. I could see the two slender,
tapering masts, but from where I was seated, here in
this chair, I could see nothing of the hull.”</p>

<p>“The <i>Goalong</i> stands rather high out of the water.
She has unusual freeboard for a craft of her size. That
fact might account for what you tell me.”</p>

<p>“Sure! I understand that now. It did account for
it—or, rather, it does account for it, as you shall see.”</p>

<p>“Well, go on.”</p>

<p>“Captain Sparkle was the last one of his crew to
leave the deck of the yacht. He stood yonder in the
bow until they had all disappeared. Then he turned,
and, after waving his hand at us, he also jumped from
the deck of the yacht and disappeared.”</p>

<p>“And then?” asked Nick.</p>

<p>“Why, then I could control myself no longer. I
leaped to my feet and started forward. I don’t know
just what I intended to do, save that my first thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
was to dive below, get a gun of some sort, and take
a shot at something. But the count stopped that.”</p>

<p>“The count? How was that?”</p>

<p>“When I leaped from my chair, he grabbed me. I
suppose I have to thank him for it, and the ladies, also,
for the pirate might have returned if I had shot at
him.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“Then we stood right here, where we are now; the
entire group; and we watched that pirate sail away
without offering a word or an act of protest. Nick,
did you ever see what is called a turtle-back craft on
the great lakes?”</p>

<p>“Often.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you should reduce the size of one of them
to about seventy-five or eighty feet, over all, and then
run a bright nickel rail all the way around her from
end to end, it would give you a better idea of that
pirate craft than anything I can think of. And yet it
is not a very correct idea, either. You will have to eliminate
the upper works of the turtle-back, and also the
funnel. Just bear in mind, will you, that the thing was
not in sight for more than two minutes, at the most,
so I had not much chance to take her measure.”</p>

<p>“Where did she go?”</p>

<p>“Go! She went like a shot out of a gun! She went
like a bullet. And she was just about the color of
the water, so it was next to impossible to see her after
she was several hundred feet away, even in that bright
moonlight.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>“I can understand that.”</p>

<p>“I wish you could have seen her.”</p>

<p>“So do I. But suppose you describe her to us, without
reference to turtle-backs. Describe her just as you
would if you had never seen a turtle-back.”</p>

<p>“All right. She was, I should say, seventy-five or
eighty feet, over all, and from sixteen to twenty feet
beam. I am guessing at it, of course.”</p>

<p>“Certainly.”</p>

<p>“She was long and narrow, and floated as if she was
rather deep in the water. She carried two masts, but
I saw no sign of a sail upon her. There was no funnel,
and when she shot away from the bow of the yacht,
her motive power, whatever it was, made no noise whatever,
so I presume she was propelled by electricity.”</p>

<p>“Storage-battery power, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Her deck was convex from end to end, and
guarded, as I have already said, by a nickel rail which
ran her entire length. Away forward there was a low
turret, shaped like an old-fashioned poke bonnet, if the
wearer of the bonnet were looking aft. This was, no
doubt, the wheel-house. Amidships there was a second
turret, shaped like an iron kettle, and about six or eight
feet in diameter. Aft there was another one, exactly
like it; and that is all.”</p>

<p>“Do you think she might have been a submarine?”</p>

<p>“No, I do not. I have thought of that, and studied
over it. She did not seem to me to be the proper model
for a submarine; at least, she was not at all the shape<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
of the generally accepted pattern for that sort of a
craft.”</p>

<p>“Well, what did she suggest to you?”</p>

<p>“Something more in the line of a small torpedo-boat
destroyer—long, narrow, low in the water, swift, almost
invisible by reason of her color, and with her upper
housings so arranged that if she should be awash in
a heavy sea she would be none the worse for it, because,
with her turrets closed and locked, not a drop
of water could get inside the hull.”</p>

<p>“Where did she go?”</p>

<p>“Straight out into the Sound. I have told you that
the tide had swung us so our bow was pointing that
way. The pirate crept in upon us while I was sitting
there aft, smoking and dreaming. He probably came in
under very little power, so that he was actually alongside
before I could hear a sound. I even doubt if I would
have seen her if I had happened to look in that direction.
And now, Nick, you have got the whole story.
What do you think about it?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t heard the count’s version of the affair
yet,” said the detective, smiling.</p>

<p>“Mine?” replied the count, stroking his imperial, and
showing his splendid teeth. “I am afraid, Mr. Carter,
that I can add very little to what has already been said.
At the present moment I can recall only one detail
which seems to have escaped the others.”</p>

<p>“And what is that, if you please?” asked the detective.</p>

<p>“I noticed merely that the pirate’s hair was very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
light in color—about what you would select for your
idea of a Norwegian viking; but I also noticed that his
eyes were very dark—black, I should say, although the
holes in his mask did not give much of an opportunity
to view them. But, if I am correct, the combination
would suggest, would it not, that the hair was a wig,
and that his own natural crown was black?”</p>

<p>“Quite so,” said Nick.</p>

<p>“And now tell us what you think about it,” insisted
Maxwell Kane.</p>

<p>“I think as you do,” replied the detective, smiling;
“that you were visited by a pirate, who has succeeded
in injuring your feelings much more than he did your
purse. But now I want you to answer some questions
which occur to me; and after that—well, after that we’ll
see what can be done.”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="smaller">“THAT FELLOW WHO LOOKS LIKE ME.”</span></h2>

<p>“Do you think you can catch him?” asked Bessie
Harlan, leaning forward in her chair, with rapt interest
depicted in her expression.</p>

<p>Nick Carter laughed aloud.</p>

<p>“It would seem, Miss Harlan,” he replied, “that at
the present moment, in order to do that, I would be
obliged to swim. Pirates do not leave clues behind
them, like burglars, outlaws, footpads, and common
thieves. You cannot pick up old buttons and locks of
hair on the crest of the waves, and there are no saloons
and other places of resort along the coast which I might
frequent in order to get on the track of one of the pirate’s
pals. However——”</p>

<p>“I see you are laughing at me,” she said.</p>

<p>“Not at all, I assure you. But you asked me if I
thought I could catch him, so I have to reply that I
don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’ll catch him, all right!” said Kane, with supreme
confidence.</p>

<p>“Do you really think so?” asked the count.</p>

<p>“If he does not,” insisted Kane, “this pirate chap will
be the first fellow Nick was ever up against whom he
did not catch in the end. But what are those questions,
Nick?”</p>

<p>“Why, I’ll begin with this one. You quoted one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
remark made by the pirate which suggested that it
might have been followed by another on the same subject
later on. But, first, let me ask you if he did take
your race cups—your trophies?”</p>

<p>“Yes—confound him! He did take them—every one
of them!”</p>

<p>“That brings me back to the question. When reference
was first made to them, you asked him to spare
you those, and he replied that he thought that subject
could be arranged. Now, his reply to you would suggest
that he intended to permit you to retain them,
provided you made up their value to him in some other
form. Was there anything of that sort mentioned?”</p>

<p>Kane leaned back in his chair, and lighted a fresh
cigar.</p>

<p>“You are a cute proposition, Nick,” he said. “I was
saving that as a sort of surprise for you, but I see
you are beyond surprising.”</p>

<p>“Then he did refer to the subject again?”</p>

<p>“No; he did not refer to it again in words, but he
left a note behind him about it.”</p>

<p>“Ah, that is better still! I begin to think that a
pirate can leave clues behind him, after all.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it was not much,” said Kane.</p>

<p>“Such as it was, however, let me see it.”</p>

<p>Kane produced his pocketbook, and from one of the
compartments took a slip of paper, which he gave into
the hand of the detective.</p>

<p>“There it is,” he said. “Read it for yourself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>The detective spread the note open before him, and
read aloud:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have taken your trophies, Mr. Kane, as you will
observe, but I will give you my promise that you shall
hear from me concerning them, and be given an opportunity
to redeem them, if you care to do so, before
they are destroyed; and for that you have the word of
Captain Sparkle, of the <i>Shadow</i>.”</p>

</div>

<p>“That must be the name of his craft, the <i>Shadow</i>,”
said Kane.</p>

<p>“Without doubt.”</p>

<p>“What do you get from the note? Anything?”</p>

<p>“I get a specimen of Sparkle’s handwriting, which, it
is true, amounts to little or nothing; but we also get
that promise, which I have no doubt he will keep, that
he will communicate with you again, and in that communication
will make some sort of a suggestion by
which you may redeem your cups.”</p>

<p>“And do you think you might be able to get on the
track in that way?”</p>

<p>“I think that such a thing is possible, although extremely
improbable. We will have to wait until we
receive the communication before we bank too much
on what it may contain.”</p>

<p>“Exactly. That is what I thought.”</p>

<p>“Tell me, did the pirate talk to you as if he were
making any effort to disguise his voice?”</p>

<p>“Not at all.”</p>

<p>“Did anything about his voice, his manner, his walk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
his air, or his conduct remind you of any living person
you know, or of anybody you have ever seen before?”</p>

<p>Kane broke out into immoderate laughter, and, turning
toward the count, he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“What did I tell you, Cadillac?” and then to Nick
he added: “Count Cadillac ought to thank his stars
that he was here aboard the yacht when the pirate
visited us, for, honestly, Carter, there was not a thing
about him which did not in some way suggest the
count himself to me.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” said Nick. “That is rather remarkable,
don’t you think so?”</p>

<p>“Highly so. I should say,” said the count.</p>

<p>Kane laughed on; but presently he said:</p>

<p>“His voice, his manner of speaking, his walk, his carriage,
his general air, his height, his figure—even his
courtly bow—was Count Cadillac all over. We have
had a good laugh about it among ourselves, Carter.
Even the count admits it to be true, and, like a good
fellow, he has consented not to take offense if I forget
myself and joke him about it.”</p>

<p>“That is very kind of you, count,” said the detective.
“It can’t be very pleasant to be told that you resemble
a pirate.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t at all mind it, Mr. Carter.”</p>

<p>“And do you yourself recognize the logic of the
suggestion?”</p>

<p>“I am forced to admit that I do.”</p>

<p>“Did the pirate, at the time he was here, remind you
of yourself?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, well, that is perhaps going too far, don’t you
know. I must confess that I did not discover it at
the time; but afterward, when the subject was brought
to my attention——”</p>

<p>“You did see it, then, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I really did, sir.”</p>

<p>“And were the ladies impressed by the same idea?”
asked Nick, turning toward them. “I mean, of course,
before it was suggested by Mr. Kane?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” replied Mrs. Kane. “We both saw it, and
spoke about it together before Max referred to it at
all.”</p>

<p>“Did it strike you, also, Miss Harlan, before your
sister spoke about it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed. I saw it at once. That was why I
took things so easy when I first came on deck. When
I saw Captain Sparkle standing there beside Max, I
thought he was the count. I suspected at that moment
that the whole thing was an entertainment of some
sort that he had gotten up for our benefit.”</p>

<p>“And you, Mrs. Kane?”</p>

<p>“You must remember that I came on deck with the
count, so I could not possibly mistake the pirate for
him; but it did occur to me, when I heard the man’s
voice, that he might be a brother, or——”</p>

<p>“Who had taken that opportunity and that occasion
to present himself to you, eh?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes; something like that. But the thought
did not have time to take form before the idea was
entirely driven out of my head.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>“Of course not”</p>

<p>“You seem to take this thing quite seriously, Carter,”
said Kane.</p>

<p>“Certainly, Max. Don’t you understand that, while
the suggestion is not at all complimentary to the count,
it still gives me rather a correct idea concerning Sparkle’s
appearance, with the red costume eliminated; and
I don’t suppose he wears that costume in private life.”</p>

<p>“I see. You mean that if you should meet somebody
in the corridor of the Waldorf, for example, who reminded
you of the count, you would immediately jump
at the conclusion that he was the pirate chief, Sparkle,
eh?”</p>

<p>“I don’t make it so emphatic as that, Max. What
do you think of it, count?” asked Nick.</p>

<p>“Oh, wouldn’t I like to catch him, whoever he may
be! Oh, wouldn’t I give him particular fits—that fellow
who looks like me!” sang the count, in reply. And
then he broke into a laugh.</p>

<p>“This is all really so ridiculous, don’t you know,”
he said; “so absurd! And yet, Mr. Carter, there is
enough truth about it to give it some interest, after
all.”</p>

<p>“Now, Max, how much property did the fellow get
away with?”</p>

<p>“As near as I can figure it, about twenty thousand
dollars’ worth. That includes the cash he took, which
amounts to almost three thousand. Why, Nick, he
didn’t leave us a solid silver piece of any description<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
on the yacht. You will see that for yourself when we
go down to luncheon.”</p>

<p>The <i>Goalong</i> was passing through Hell Gate at the
moment, and Nick, who had been thinking deeply since
Kane’s last remark, turned to him suddenly.</p>

<p>“I believe you said we were bound for the anchorage,
where the pirate visited you, eh?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“What was your idea in doing that?”</p>

<p>“Well, I thought you might like to see the ground—that
is, the ripples—where the thing occurred.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I would,” said Nick seriously. And then he
added: “Do you happen to have bathing-suits aboard,
Max?”</p>

<p>“Sure! Why? Want to take a swim?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I thought of it. I always feel that way when
I get out on the water! and it is a very warm day,
don’t you think?”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet it is hot enough to boil eggs along Broadway
by this time.”</p>

<p>“How deep is the water at the anchorage, Max—I
mean at the buoy where you tied up last night?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t an idea. Thirty feet, perhaps.”</p>

<p>“We’ll be there presently, and after we have anchored,
if the ladies will indulge me in the desire, I will borrow
one of those bathing-suits and take a dip. Who will
join me?” he added, taking them all in in his question.</p>

<p>But Kane alone replied in the affirmative. The count
shrugged his shoulders, and remarked that he would
much prefer his book and a cigar under the awning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
and the ladies said they would seize that opportunity
to be put ashore, in order that they might make the
calls in the neighborhood which they had been unable
to do the preceding evening.</p>

<p>Thirty minutes later the <i>Goalong</i> was made fast to
the buoy where she was floating at the time of Captain
Sparkle’s unannounced visit.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="smaller">NICK’S DEDUCTIONS.</span></h2>

<p>The detective was not sorry when, a little later, he
found that the ladies had prevailed upon the count to
accompany them on their trip ashore; and that, therefore,
he would be left alone on the yacht with Maxwell
Kane. And, as soon as the yacht was deserted, save
for themselves and the crew, the two friends lost no
time in getting into the bathing-suits.</p>

<p>Before either of them dived into the depths of the
water, however, Nick dropped into one of the chairs
under the awning and motioned to Kane to take the
seat beside him.</p>

<p>“We have plenty of time,” he said, “and I would like
to get a few more whiffs out of this cigar before I
throw it away. Tell me, Max, how do you account for
that resemblance?”</p>

<p>“What resemblance?”</p>

<p>“Between the pirate and the count.”</p>

<p>“Why, I have not thought to try to account for it.
I suppose it is one of those extraordinary coincidences
which are always inexplicable.”</p>

<p>“Did you ever happen to run across a coincidence
which was entirely inexplicable, Max?” asked Nick.</p>

<p>“Why, yes, I think so.”</p>

<p>“Well, I have not.”</p>

<p>“Eh? What do you mean?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>“I meant that the things we denominate by the rather
vague term ‘coincidence’ inevitably have a direct relation
between them, if you take the trouble to trace each
one to its original source.”</p>

<p>“Which means—what?”</p>

<p>“Which means that, according to my theory, there
should be something more than now appears on the surface
to explain this unaccountable resemblance between
the pirate and the count.”</p>

<p>“Surely, Nick, you don’t mean to accuse the count
of——”</p>

<p>“I don’t mean to accuse anybody of anything. I am
merely endeavoring to explain a circumstance which
strikes me as being remarkable, to say the least.”</p>

<p>“But, Nick——”</p>

<p>“Wait, please. If you had been the only one to
notice the resemblance, I should have paid no attention
whatever to it.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, awfully!”</p>

<p>“I don’t mean my remark that way, Max. I do
mean that your unsupported theory in that respect would
not have been of sufficient importance to have attracted
my attention. I should, in that case, have regarded it
merely as a phantom of your own brain.”</p>

<p>“I see what you are getting at.”</p>

<p>“No, you don’t—yet. Not quite.”</p>

<p>“Well, go ahead, then, and explain.”</p>

<p>“Let us look at the thing calmly, candidly, and logically.”</p>

<p>“Certainly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>“You have known—and so have I—circumstances
where you have thought a child to exactly resemble its
father, while another person would be equally strong in
the belief that it hadn’t a trace of its father about it, but,
on the contrary, was a picture of its mother.”</p>

<p>“Hundreds of them.”</p>

<p>“Again, we might go out some evening, and, while
we were together, meet with a person of whom I would
say, ‘Max, that young woman reminds me of your wife’s
sister,’ and I would be surprised when you replied that
they were no more alike than chalk and cheese. You
know of instances of that kind, eh?”</p>

<p>“Loads of them.”</p>

<p>“And I don’t suppose it ever occurred to you to
make any effort to explain this seemingly remarkable
diversity of opinion upon a very simple and apparently
plain subject, eh?”</p>

<p>“No, save that I have always let it go with the
private opinion that the other fellow was not half as
observant as I.”</p>

<p>“Exactly. But if you had chosen to investigate, you
would have discovered a well-defined reason for the
difference of opinion.”</p>

<p>“Humph! Well, I never thought about it. What is
it?”</p>

<p>“This: No human being appears exactly the same to
one acquaintance or friend as he does to another. To
make it more plain, there are no two persons in the
world to whom your personality, and therefore your
appearance, is the same. The count does not look at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
you through the same glasses that I use. The captain
of your yacht does not know you as your engineer
knows you, and vice versa. You have as many personalities
as you have associates, acquaintances, friends—what
you will.”</p>

<p>“I will grant you that; but what has all this to do
with the particular case we are discussing?”</p>

<p>“Much, if you will wait till I finish.”</p>

<p>“All right, old man; go ahead.”</p>

<p>“Associated with every person alive there are points
of resemblance which might be denominated common
property. Another person who has been introduced to
the count, as I have been this morning, would recognize
him as I would, also, if they happened to encounter
each other on the street; but, if you should dress the
count up in a costume similar to the one the pirate
wore, there is not one out of ten who would even be
reminded of the count at such an encounter, unless he
made some gesture—not one, but several, mind you—which
would bring him to mind. I don’t know if I
make myself plain.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you do—entirely so!”</p>

<p>“Now, if, on the other hand, it was expected that
the count would appear in some such outlandish costume,
the whole ten would recognize him at once—see?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Oliver Wendell Holmes tells us that when John and
Thomas encounter each other on the highway, there are
six persons talking.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>“How is that? You are getting beyond me now.”</p>

<p>“There is John as he thinks he is, John as Thomas
thinks he is, and John as God knows he is; and there
is Thomas as he thinks he is, Thomas as John thinks
he is, and Thomas as God knows he is. So, you see,
there are six, quite plainly.”</p>

<p>“Well, Nick?”</p>

<p>“When that pirate chief came aboard this yacht, while
he was standing here on the deck with you, his personality
was like his face, masked.”</p>

<p>“Exactly.”</p>

<p>“When your wife’s sister came on the deck, she sought
at once—as any other person would have done—to pierce
that mask.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Her impressions were not coerced in any direction
by misgivings. She had not been frightened; she did
not know that there was occasion for fear of any kind;
her first idea of the affair was that it was some sort
of a hoax.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And in her first effort to pierce that mask which
the pirate wore over his personality, if I may use the
expression to convey an idea, she saw what you had
already seen—a suggestion of the count.”</p>

<p>“That is as sure as you are born!”</p>

<p>“As she advanced toward you, that first impression
grew upon her, and it was not until he had made some
pronounced gesture, muscular or vocal, that she changed
her opinion.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>“Right.”</p>

<p>“Now, let us go a little further. When your wife
came on deck, her mind was in the same condition as
Miss Harlan’s; that is, she also saw no occasion for
fright. But, again, the count was with her, and, therefore,
she could not mistake the pirate for him. But,
notwithstanding all that, she saw the likeness, or felt it,
and it was so evident to her that it was impressed as
strongly upon her as upon her sister.”</p>

<p>“Well, gee whiz, Nick, the pirate wasn’t the count!”</p>

<p>“I know that. But the pirate, whose whole personality
was cloaked in a disguise, and who wore a mask upon
his face as well as upon his person, still possessed those
attributes which every person finds it almost impossible
to conceal; certain characteristics which are born with
us, which we inherit, or which we assume from constant
habit, and which may be found among members
of the same family, almost without exception.</p>

<p>“Now, wait, Max. I, personally, have made it my
study to know what those attributes and characteristics
are, so far as I am directly concerned, in order that,
in the pursuit of my profession, I may throw them aside,
as far as possible, when I have occasion to assume a
disguise; and I have studied them in others, in order
that I may be able to recognize another person by them,
when that other person has assumed a disguise.”</p>

<p>“I see.”</p>

<p>“But the average man has not done so. For example,
you could not so disguise yourself that I would
not recognize you on the instant; but I could so change<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
my appearance that you would not guess my personality
in a thousand years.”</p>

<p>“I believe that—in fact, I know it.”</p>

<p>“What I could perform in that particular, the average
man would find impossible of accomplishment. You are
an average man under the rule I am laying down, and so
is the pirate chief.”</p>

<p>“Precisely. I follow you.”</p>

<p>“On the occasion of his visit to this yacht, his mask
and his disguise sufficiently concealed his identity so that
he had no fear, or even thought, of being recognized
when he was seen again by any of you, if he ever should
be.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And, again, it is a presumption that he has never
met any of you, and, therefore, there was, in his opinion,
no occasion to conceal those attributes and characteristics
to which I have already referred.”</p>

<p>“I am beginning to catch on to your idea.”</p>

<p>“Therefore, he brought his attributes and his characteristics
with him. He did not think it necessary to put
them aside with his citizens’ clothing. He wore them,
just as he wore his arms, his legs, and his head—because
they were a necessary part of him.”</p>

<p>“Precisely. I see the point.”</p>

<p>“Now, you, Miss Harlan and your wife had no means
of identifying the man himself; you could only identify
his characteristics.”</p>

<p>“I like attributes better; the word comprehends more.”</p>

<p>“All right. Let it go at that. You could only identify<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
his attributes; that is to say, his gestures, mannerisms,
the keynote of his voice, rather than the voice itself;
his carriage; his step in walking, rather than the walk
itself——”</p>

<p>“You refer to the method of putting his foot to the
deck—that is what I noticed.”</p>

<p>“Yes; his method of putting his foot down. That is
inevitably a family characteristic, and may be almost
invariably recognized, whether a man is bow-legged,
halt, or crippled in any way. You could only recognize
the outward visible signs. Your wife and her sister were
in the same category. There was no suggestion made
to any one of you, or between any two of you. In
each case it was an individual opinion, based upon some
recognized quality.”</p>

<p>“By Jove, Nick!”</p>

<p>“With you, that recognized quality consisted in his
manner of putting his feet to the deck when he walked;
in the cases of your wife and her sister, the quality
was doubtless a different one in each case, so we may
conclude that there were at least three separate and
distinct characteristics which led three people to the
same conclusion; and bear in mind that not one of you
three people is a close observer. Bear in mind, also,
that not one of the three were expecting what was
discovered, but that the thing you did discover was
an unmistakable suggestion of the personality of your
guest, the Count of Cadillac.”</p>

<p>“Great Jehoshaphat, Nick! What in the world do you
mean to try to deduce from all that? Eh?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>“What do you think about it yourself?”</p>

<p>“I’m blessed if I know what to think! You’ve got
me all tangled up, if anybody should ask you. Tell me
what you think?”</p>

<p>“Well, Max, my profession is a strange one. I go
my ways by signs. Family characteristics and personal
attributes, as applied to identification, is one of my hobbies.
I don’t intend, at the present moment, to cast any
unkind insinuation upon your guest; but, all the same,
while I am looking for this pirate, I shall also look up
the family traits, characteristics, and personal attributes
of Jean, Compte de Cadillac.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE MARK OF THE ROVER’S KEEL.</span></h2>

<p>Kane remained like a statue in his chair, staring at
the detective. The suggestions thrown out by Nick
Carter concerning Count Cadillac paralyzed him, so to
speak. He was appalled by it, and—he could not bring
himself to the belief that there was anything in it more
than that strange circumstance which he had described
in the beginning as circumstance. And yet, all the while,
he was forced to admit to himself that there were suspicious
circumstances.</p>

<p>Suddenly, without a word of his intention, but being
already garbed in his bathing-suit, he kicked off the
sandals he wore, leaped to his feet, reached the side of
the yacht with one bound, and dived into the water.</p>

<p>Just as he poised on the rail, he shouted to the detective
to “come on,” and so he had scarcely disappeared
in the water before Nick was after him. But
when Nick Carter dived he did not come immediately
to the surface, as did Maxwell Kane. The moment he
was underneath the surface he turned toward the bow
of the yacht, and, continuing under the water, he passed
under the vessel’s bow to the port side before coming
to the top again for air.</p>

<p>After a moment he heard Kane calling, and, not wishing
to frighten his host, he answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>“Come along forward, Max,” he called. “I have a
suggestion to make.”</p>

<p>“Well, what is it?” asked Kane, when he appeared.</p>

<p>“As nearly as I can determine from the description
you have given me, the yacht is lying in relatively the
same position she occupied when the pirate came aboard
of her, is she not? Isn’t she headed about the same?”</p>

<p>“I should say that she could not be put more exactly
in the same spot,” replied Max.</p>

<p>“In that case,” said Nick, pointing with his finger,
“the pirate craft should have been lying about yonder—so,
while Captain Sparkle was giving you his original
impersonation of <i>Hamlet</i>.”</p>

<p>“Yes; her bow must have been about yonder, and
her stern out there”—indicating with gestures the positions
he described.</p>

<p>“And when Sparkle and his men went over the side
from the yacht to their own craft, where is the point
where they did that?”</p>

<p>“Right here—directly over our heads.”</p>

<p>“When the pirate craft left you, she must have gone
in that direction,” continued the detective, pointing
toward the Sound.</p>

<p>“Yes, that is about it.”</p>

<p>“All right. Thank you.”</p>

<p>Nick had been clinging to the bowsprit-stay while he
was talking; but now, without more remarks, he released
his hold upon it and permitted himself to sink
slowly into the depths.</p>

<p>Kane happened to be looking away from him at that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
moment, and he continued, through several sentences, his
description of how the pirate had sailed out of the harbor
into the open Sound, where she had finally disappeared.
Perceiving, presently, that his description was
not received with the enthusiasm he had a right to expect,
he turned his head, and for the first time discovered
that the detective was no longer there.</p>

<p>Kane was a strong swimmer, but was not overfond
of diving, and so, instead of pursuing the detective, who
he expected had merely gone under the vessel in order
to reach the other side, he swam away lustily toward
the stern, and climbed upon the deck again, where he
seated himself under the shade of the awning.</p>

<p>But Nick Carter had not permitted himself to sink
beneath the water merely for the purpose of disappearing
in order to reappear again at another spot. In fact, his
request for the bathing-suit, and for the opportunity to
use it, had been with a well-defined motive other than
the mere pleasure to be derived from a dip in the sea.</p>

<p>The detective really wished to examine the bottom of
the cove. The idea did not occur to him because he
believed that he would discover any suggestive trace of
the pirate down there, but he put the thought into words
because it was his professional habit never to neglect
even the most trivial and apparently unimportant item
from his investigations.</p>

<p>The idea of examining the bottom of the Sound for
traces of a vessel which had passed over that spot would
be absurdly ludicrous; but, all the same, there was one
idea which had been suggested to Nick by the description<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Kane had given him of the pirate craft, and he believed
it to be more than possible that there might be
an indication of the fact—if it were a fact—to be found
at the bottom, not far from the buoy to which the yacht
was moored.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that he asked Kane if he thought
the pirate craft was a submarine, and it must be recorded
that, notwithstanding the reply he received, he thought
it more than probable that the silent approach of the
vessel had been accomplished in that way.</p>

<p>Nick knew that the bottom of that cove was soft,
and largely composed of clay, especially at points where
it attained as great a depth as that where the yacht
was moored.</p>

<p>Clay is impressionable. It will receive and hold the
shape of an article which rests upon it a considerable
time, and the detective argued that if the <i>Shadow</i>, as
she was called, had at any moment rested upon the bottom
at that particular point, she would have left her
mark there. That she was a submarine, or at least was
capable of diving beneath the surface and remaining
there for some time, he had not a doubt. The very fact
that she had approached the <i>Goalong</i> so silently that her
proximity was not suspected was sufficiently satisfactory
of that idea to him.</p>

<p>The water was, fortunately, unusually clear, and Nick
had no difficulty in examining the bottom almost at his
leisure. When he came to the surface again, and climbed
up on the deck to a seat beside his friend, he remarked:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, Max, it is as I thought. Your pirate craft is
some sort of a submarine.”</p>

<p>“Is she? How do you know that? Have you seen
her?”</p>

<p>“Well, not exactly.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know but that was why you stayed under
water so long. I thought maybe you had gone after
her.”</p>

<p>“Well, you weren’t far wrong, at that. I figured that
if she could dive, that was pretty nearly the explanation
of how she approached you so silently, and, following
up that idea, I decided that if she did dive, she must
have left a mark of some kind on the bottom not far
from that buoy.”</p>

<p>“And you found one, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I found one.”</p>

<p>“What was it?”</p>

<p>“Merely the impression of her keel in the clay at the
bottom.”</p>

<p>“And I suppose that from that impression, which
would mean nothing at all to me, you have read enough
facts about the pirate to fill quite a respectable book,
eh?”</p>

<p>Nick laughed.</p>

<p>“No, Max,” he said. “For once you are wrong, and
for once I did not find anything more than you would
have discovered had you gone there in my place. All
I know from what I saw there is that a vessel’s keel
has rested on the bottom within the last twenty-four
hours. I could tell, of course, approximately, her length,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
and from that could make a good guess at her breadth
of beam, but you have already done that for me. Now,
old chap, let’s get into our clothes.”</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later, they were reclothed and seated
again in their favorite chairs under the awning.</p>

<p>“And now, Nick, what next?” asked Kane.</p>

<p>“First, tell me what yacht is that one, heading in
here toward the anchorage?” replied Nick, pointing over
Kane’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“Oh, that? She is Burton’s auxiliary, the <i>Harkaway</i>,”
replied Kane. “There will be half a dozen more of
them in here before sundown. There is a regular meeting
of the club to-night, and I shouldn’t wonder if there
would be a score or more of yachts in here between now
and midnight.”</p>

<p>“If the pirate only knew that, it might prove to be
a harvest for him, don’t you think?” asked Nick.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know about that. There would be too
many of them for him, wouldn’t there?”</p>

<p>“Not if he is a submarine, and he is one. And say,
Max, that thought suggests a question.”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“Does the count happen to know about that meeting?”</p>

<p>“What meeting? Oh, you mean the club meeting?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. You just referred to it.”</p>

<p>“Why, yes. I suppose he knows about it. He has
heard me say that I wished to be at the meeting to-night.”</p>

<p>“So he also knows that there will be a lot of craft at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
this anchorage to-night, and that the owners and guests
from them, almost to an individual, will be ashore at
the club-house, doesn’t he?”</p>

<p>“I have never regarded him as a fool, Nick, and he
would have to be pretty near one if he didn’t know
that.”</p>

<p>“And I suppose, Max, that you are looking forward
to creating a sensation when you tell the bunch about
how you were boarded by a pirate and robbed like a
gentleman, eh?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes——”</p>

<p>“It is too bad to take that privilege from you, old
man, but I really wish you would say nothing whatever
about it, and that you would caution your wife and
guests to observe the same silence. I will only hold you
to that for to-night. To-morrow you can tell the whole
world about it if you like.”</p>

<p>“But why so mighty secret about it to-night, Nick?”</p>

<p>“Because, Max, I expect that the pirate will make another
call on the fleet to-night. It would be a splendid
time for him to come; and if he happens to have any
idea of putting in an appearance, I would rather not
have the whole bunch of owners and their friends rush
to their vessels from the club-house, after hearing your
story, just in time to spoil the pirate’s plans. I would
rather he’d have the coast clear for to-night, if he does
intend to come, and if you yapped about the business
the scene might be spoiled.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="smaller">CAPTAIN SPARKLE’S SECOND VICTIM.</span></h2>

<p>“Max,” said Nick, after a pause, during which he
had been watching the maneuvers of the <i>Harkaway</i> as
she came to her buoy on the anchorage, “I have not
asked the question before, because I thought there was
no need; but have you ever heard the suggestion that
there was a pirate in this part of the world, before you
met with your own experience?”</p>

<p>“Never.”</p>

<p>“It is a pretty sure thing, isn’t it, that if somebody
else had run afoul of him as you did, you would have
heard of it?”</p>

<p>“I think it is; unless some other fellow has been
boarded who felt about as cheap as I do about it, and
has resolved to keep it to himself until somebody else
speaks. That is why I had made up my mind to let
out the whole thing at the club meeting to-night.”</p>

<p>“But, even in that case, the information would have
been likely to leak out, don’t you suppose?”</p>

<p>“I certainly do.”</p>

<p>“I imagine there is a beginning to the career of a
pirate, the same as there would be the beginning of a
career in other professions, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Naturally.”</p>

<p>“And has it occurred to you that the fellow was sort
of getting his hand in on you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>“Eh? What is that?”</p>

<p>“That he was practising on you?”</p>

<p>“Maybe he was. You can search me.”</p>

<p>“You see, if there had been other robberies, we would
have heard of it. If that pirate had been doing this
sort of thing for an indefinite time, somebody would
have talked about it before this, so I think it is safe
to suppose that you have the honor of being Captain
Sparkle’s first victim.”</p>

<p>“I have had that idea myself, Nick. Hello! What’s
the matter with Burton?”</p>

<p>“He seems to be wigwagging you,” remarked Nick,
turning his head so he could observe the owner of the
<i>Harkaway</i>.</p>

<p>“Well, I wish he would have himself put aboard here,
and do his talking like a Christian. I never could get
that wigwagging business into my head,” growled Kane.</p>

<p>“I’ll read it for you,” said Nick.</p>

<p>“I wish to goodness you would.”</p>

<p>After a moment of attentive observation, Nick rose
from his chair and went to the rail, from which place
he also went through with a series of pantomimic gestures,
and for several moments this was kept up between
him and Burton, aboard the other yacht. Then he turned
again to his host.</p>

<p>“Your friend Burton wigwags that he has met the
pirate,” he said quietly.</p>

<p>“The devil he does!” replied Kane.</p>

<p>“I have suggested to him that he say as little about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
it as possible for the present, and that he order his men
to keep silent, also; and I have taken the liberty to ask
him to come aboard here at once and tell us all about
it.”</p>

<p>“I’m mighty glad you did that.”</p>

<p>“Here he comes now. He will be here in a moment.”</p>

<p>“I’m jolly glad we have got the <i>Goalong</i> to ourselves,”
said Kane.</p>

<p>He rose then, and went to the side, where he awaited
the arrival of his friend.</p>

<p>“Glad to make your acquaintance, Mr. Burton,” said
the detective, when they were introduced. “I hope you
appreciated the logic of my suggestions while we were
wigwagging each other.”</p>

<p>“Entirely so. Like you, I think it is well to keep quiet
about it for awhile. At least, until we all get together
at the meeting to-night.”</p>

<p>“And even then, also,” said Nick. “Mr. Kane was
boarded and robbed by the pirate last night, while the
<i>Goalong</i> was lying at this very buoy. He went to the
city after me this morning, and we think that we already
have some ideas about the new rover of the seas—or
shall we call him ‘The Pirate of the Sound’?”</p>

<p>“That seems to be as good a title as any. So you
were robbed, eh, Kane?”</p>

<p>“Yes; last night. Just as Carter says.”</p>

<p>“Have you ever heard that anybody else has met the
fellow?”</p>

<p>“No; I have not.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nor I. We must be the first ones on his list.”</p>

<p>“That is what Carter and I were just saying.”</p>

<p>“He tackled you right here at the anchorage, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And now, if you don’t mind, I would like to put
in a word,” said Nick.</p>

<p>“All right, Mr. Carter,” replied Burton. “Please consider
that I am at your orders.”</p>

<p>“Where did you meet with the pirate?”</p>

<p>“Right out in the middle of the Sound, about off
Hempstead Bay.”</p>

<p>“When?”</p>

<p>“Just at the break of day.”</p>

<p>“How did he approach you? How did he come
aboard?”</p>

<p>“As for the manner in which he approached me, I
have only the account of my men to rely upon, for I was
asleep in my berth at the time.”</p>

<p>“Tell me, then, what was told you about it.”</p>

<p>“Simmons—he’s my captain—tells me that it was just
coming daylight when he noticed a strange-looking craft
lying directly across our bows, half a dozen cable-lengths
ahead of us. We were going under half-speed at the
time, and Simmons had just taken in his lights.</p>

<p>“He whistled to pass to starboard, and put his helm
over for that purpose, when, much to his surprise, the
stranger backed swiftly, so that he kept directly across
our course.</p>

<p>“Simmons didn’t know what to make of that, so he
whistled to pass to port, and changed his course to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
that, thinking that perhaps the stranger’s engines were
disabled, or something of that kind.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“The strange-looking craft, instead of replying to
Simmons’ signal, shot ahead, and again laid across our
course, and by this time Simmons had approached so
closely that he was compelled to reverse his engines in
order to avoid a collision.</p>

<p>“He only escaped one by a hair’s breadth, too. When
we came to a stop, there wasn’t more than two or three
fathoms between us and the other craft.”</p>

<p>“A narrow shave, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes. By this time I had been roused by the blowing
of our whistle, and I went on deck, half-dressed. There
are no ladies on board the <i>Harkaway</i>. And I made my
appearance just in time to see the amidships turret of
the stranger thrown open and half a dozen men appear
on her deck.”</p>

<p>“Your captain’s first idea was anger at the stranger,
I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Naturally; and he told them what he thought of
their carelessness in the choicest sort of phrase, but they
paid no more attention to him than you would to a
honey-bee; and the next thing we knew was that we
had drifted alongside, and the stranger had made fast
to us.</p>

<p>“You see, Mr. Carter, it was all done so quickly and
so deftly, and was so totally unexpected, that we had
no time to prevent it, even if we had been on our guard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
after the first discovery of the pirate; and we had no
sooner touched and they had their lines fast, than half
a dozen of their men leaped aboard of us.”</p>

<p>“Were they masked?” asked Kane.</p>

<p>“Yes, masked, and armed, too, with rifles. They covered
the whole lot of us in a jiffy; and more than that,
their captain, who now appeared on the deck of the
pirate, sang out to us, and at the same time pointed at
his amidships turret—the one I mentioned a moment ago.</p>

<p>“Say, Kane, I’ll give you my word that I thought
then that the whole thing was a huge joke of some
sort that somebody was attempting to play on me. It
looked like a scene out of a melodrama, or an opera.
It’s a wonder I didn’t laugh; only I was too angry to
do that, you know.”</p>

<p>“Tell me about it,” said Nick.</p>

<p>“Well, there were the six masked men on our own
deck, with six ugly-looking rifles aimed at us. And
there was the captain of the pirate vessel, standing at
ease on his own deck, dressed like a revival of <i>Hamlet</i>
who had been dipped in crimson dye, for he was
as red as a poppy; and there, in the amidships turret,
was the prettiest-looking brass-mouthed, rapid-fire gun
you ever saw, frowning upon us.”</p>

<p>“Gee! That is more than he treated me to!” said
Kane.</p>

<p>“Well, it was there, all right. There was another
pirate standing at the breech, too, ready to set the thing
going if he was ordered to do so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>“The pirate chief was pointing at it when he sang out
to us, and what he said was this:</p>

<p>“‘My men have orders to fire if you make the slightest
show of resistance; and, you see, that with this machine-gun,
I could mow you down without mercy. Take
my advice and keep quiet, and I promise you that no
one shall be injured.’</p>

<p>“‘Who the devil are you?’ I demanded.</p>

<p>“He made no reply to that, but swung himself aboard
the yacht and walked directly up to me.</p>

<p>“‘You are Mr. Philip Burton, are you not?’ he asked;
and I——”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute, Burton,” interrupted Kane. “Did
you notice anything familiar about his voice—eh?”</p>

<p>“Not just at that moment; but later—before he went
away—I say, you know, it’s a devilish mean thing for
me to say, Kane.”</p>

<p>“Say it all the same. Did he remind you of me, perhaps?”</p>

<p>“No; but he did remind me of that chap you brought
aboard the <i>Harkaway</i> the other evening at Newport.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean Count Cadillac?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Kane, I mean the count. I suppose he is here
with you, is he not?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He has gone ashore with the ladies just at
present. But never mind all that. Go ahead with your
affair.”</p>

<p>“I hope you will pardon me for——”</p>

<p>“Oh, bosh! We’ve been through all that. The count
knows all about it, too. He—the pirate, I mean—reminded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
us of the count, too. The count saw it himself.
That was why I asked you the question. He won’t be
offended. Go on with your yarn.”</p>

<p>“Well, as I was saying, he asked me if I was Burton,
and I replied that I was. Then he made me a bow that
would have made Harry Lehr green with envy, and replied:</p>

<p>“‘Permit me to introduce myself. I am Captain Sparkle,
of the pirate cruiser <i>Shadow</i>. I will have to trouble
you to the extent of collecting such valuables and cash
as you may happen to have aboard, and I trust you will
understand that this is no joke; in fact, that I am very
much in earnest.’</p>

<p>“‘You at least have that appearance—all save your
costume,’ I said to him; but he paid no attention to that
remark.</p>

<p>“‘My men will now make the collection,’ he continued;
‘and I wish to assure you that nobody will be molested
unless resistance is offered, in which case I shall not
hesitate to shed blood if necessary.’</p>

<p>“‘Well,’ I said, ‘since you seem to have the drop on
me, go ahead.’</p>

<p>“He ordered my men aft, under the awning, after
asking me if there were others below anywhere, and being
assured that I was alone, save for my crew. Then
two of his men stood guard over us while the others
did the looting. And say, they did it to the queen’s
taste, too. I haven’t got a thing left aboard which would
pawn for a twenty-dollar note, so help me!</p>

<p>“They carted the things to the deck in sacks, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
sheets, and pillow-cases, and any old thing they could
discover to put them in, and they took all the silver I
had, all my prize cups, half a dozen cases of that old
port which I consider priceless, and, in fact, everything
they could lay their hands on. Then, before they went
away, one of the men lifted my watch, my pin, about
seven hundred in cash which I happened to have about
me, and even my links. Now, what do you think of
that?”</p>

<p>“What next?”</p>

<p>“What next! What do you want next? Isn’t that
enough? There wasn’t any ‘next,’ save that Captain
Sparkle went aboard of his own craft, following his men,
disappeared below, pulled down the turret covers after
him, and sped away like a shot out of a gun. Say,
Kane, that <i>Shadow</i> is the fastest thing I ever saw. She
could go around me twice in ten miles, and I’m not
taking any dust off the ocean from anybody around here,
as you know. Well, that’s my story. I thought I’d
take a flier over here and tell the boys about it. Just
fancy! A pirate! In Long Island Sound! In the year
of our Lord nineteen hundred and six! Who would
believe it? Eh?”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="smaller">WAITING FOR THE PIRATE’S ATTACK.</span></h2>

<p>“Now, Mr. Burton,” said the detective, when the story
was finished, “I wish you would do me a favor.”</p>

<p>“Certainly. What will it be, Mr. Carter?”</p>

<p>“I wish you would keep your men aboard the yacht
for the remainder of the day and evening, for one thing.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do that, certainly.”</p>

<p>“And, in addition to that, instruct them to say nothing
of what has happened to anybody, on pain of dismissal.”</p>

<p>“All right; and that, also.”</p>

<p>“Next, I wish you would keep silent yourself—until
to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p>“Humph! Well, all right. It spoils a good story, however.”</p>

<p>“It is possible that we may have a better one to tell
by that time.”</p>

<p>“How is that?”</p>

<p>“I suppose you are aware who I am, are you not?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Detectives are always excusable for having theories.”</p>

<p>“Sure! If they had no theories, they would never
have facts, would they?”</p>

<p>“Probably not. Now, I’ve got a theory about this
matter, although it is built upon a very weak and tottering
foundation. However, if my theory happens to be
a good one—that is, if it amounts to anything at all, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
will bring Captain Sparkle into this harbor to-night,
among the fleet which will be anchored here.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean it!”</p>

<p>“I do mean it—provided my theory is correct. If it
is false, he will not come, and in that way I will know
that it is false.”</p>

<p>“While if he does come, you will know that it is
correct?”</p>

<p>“Not positively; but I will be pretty well satisfied on
that point.”</p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

<p>“Now, if there should happen to be much talk at the
club to-night about this pirate and his daring robberies,
the owners of the yachts would make a rush for their
craft anchored here. They would desert the club-house,
go aboard their vessels, arm themselves, and wait up the
whole night in the expectation of seeing the pirate. It
is true that they would make more or less of a joke of
it, but they would do it all the same, and in that case,
if my theory still holds good, the pirate chief would receive
a signal of some kind, and he would not show up.”</p>

<p>“I see the point, only I don’t understand about the
signal.”</p>

<p>“That is a part of my theory.”</p>

<p>“Do I understand you to mean that some person connected
with the club is in league with the pirate, and
would notify him not to appear?”</p>

<p>“No; I do not exactly mean all that. But my meaning
is near enough to that idea, so that I wish nothing
to be said at present.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>“Very good. I’ll be mum.”</p>

<p>“Now, I wish you two to go ashore together. I want
you, Kane, to call up my house over the telephone, and
get my assistant, Chick, on the other end of the wire.
Ask him to come out here as soon as possible, by rail.
He can get here in about fifty minutes.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Please arrange to meet him somewhere—at the station
would be the best place—and bring him quietly to
the yacht.”</p>

<p>“Here, you mean? To the <i>Goalong</i>?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Very good.”</p>

<p>“Then go back to the club-house and stay there until
I send for you.”</p>

<p>“Humph! What the devil—— I say, what are you
going to do?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to stay here.”</p>

<p>“And wait for the pirate to show up?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Alone?”</p>

<p>“No; I will have Chick with me.”</p>

<p>“Well, I register a kick, Carter.”</p>

<p>“Why so?”</p>

<p>“Because I wish to be here, too, to see the fun. If
you will make that amendment to your orders, I’m your
man.”</p>

<p>Nick shook his head negatively.</p>

<p>“I am afraid that won’t do,” he said. “You see, if you
do that, you’ll end by having the ladies, the count, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
perhaps half a dozen guests out here, and I don’t want
them—particularly one of them. You understand.”</p>

<p>“Yes. But if I could assure you that we would not
be troubled—eh? If Burton, here, will do the ashore act
for me, and I can arrange it so that we won’t be
bothered—eh?”</p>

<p>“Why, in that case I will have no objections.”</p>

<p>“All right. I’ll go now. Come along, Burton. We’ll
stop at your yacht on the way, and give your men the
necessary orders. Hello! It is about time we were doing
it, too. There comes Myers with the <i>Wyoming</i>,
and if I am not mistaken, that is Harcourt out beyond
him.”</p>

<p>As he was about to leave the deck of the yacht to
leap into the gig awaiting him, he added:</p>

<p>“I’ll attend to that telephone, old chap, and I will
bring Chick out to you the minute he arrives. I’ll head
off the women, too, and I’ll see to it that we are not
disturbed out here to-night. I only hope the pirate will
show up.”</p>

<p>“I think he will,” replied Nick.</p>

<p>When the detective was alone, he seated himself, with
a freshly lighted cigar, to think.</p>

<p>“I never built up a theory upon so small a fact before,”
he mused. “If anybody else suggested the like of it to
me, I would not entertain it; but, all the same, I think
intuition has a great deal to do with our decisions in
life, and if intuition amounts to a thing, it is as sure as
shooting that Count Cadillac has got something to do
with that pirate. It is only a guess, pure and simple,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
but I have won out more than once on a guess, and, in
this particular matter, I can’t hurt the count any by making
it, while I may help myself a good deal. The pirate
might come in here to-night, anyhow, even if the
count has nothing to do with him, for if he is keeping
tabs very closely on things, he must know that a lot of
yachts will anchor here in the next few hours; but if,
on the other hand, the count has got something to do
with him, and there should be grounds for alarm, he
would find a way to notify Mr. Pirate to keep off the
grass for to-night.”</p>

<p>The afternoon waned and merged into evening. The
shadows fell, and night was at hand. The stars came
out, and, with them, a small boat pushed off from the
shore and approached the yacht.</p>

<p>A few moments later Kane, accompanied by Chick,
came aboard. In the meantime, many yachts and craft
had entered the little harbor anchorage, until now, as
darkness fell, there was at least a score of them all told,
of all sizes, shapes, and designs, and there was no doubt
that by ten o’clock there would be at least half as many
more.</p>

<p>“I suppose you have figured it all out, Nick?” said
Kane, when he came aboard.</p>

<p>“Yes; I have been figuring a little.”</p>

<p>“Well, I have saved you one task. I have told Chick
the whole story: mine and Burton’s, too.”</p>

<p>“Good! I am glad of that.”</p>

<p>“What time do you figure that Captain Sparkle will
pay us a visit, if he comes at all?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not before toward morning, I imagine.”</p>

<p>“Why do you put it so late?”</p>

<p>“Well, he will suppose that many of the people here
will remain at the club until late, and will still prefer
to sleep aboard their yachts.”</p>

<p>“Sure. And some of them will do that very thing.
However, I have arranged for our particular outfit to
remain at the club to-night; and I did another thing,
too.”</p>

<p>“What was that?”</p>

<p>“I put Burton next to that idea about the count. I
had to do it, and Burton is all right, you know. If it
should turn out that we are entirely mistaken about it,
nobody will ever get a word about it out of Burton; you
can bet your sweet life on that.”</p>

<p>“Very good. Well, what did you do?”</p>

<p>“I told Burton to stick tighter than a brother to the
count all the evening, and to keep him and some of the
other fellows going till the wee small hours of the morning
at that. I don’t want him to get an opportunity
to do any of that signaling you talked about.”</p>

<p>“Nor I.”</p>

<p>“Then I played up sick. Knocked out, you know.
Said I was coming off to the yacht and turn in.”</p>

<p>“That was a good idea, too.”</p>

<p>“Now, Nick, what is the next thing?”</p>

<p>“The next thing is to wait.”</p>

<p>“That is about the hardest thing in the world to do.”</p>

<p>“That is what we will have to do for the present.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
There won’t be anything doing at the pirate’s end of the
string before two o’clock—if there is then.”</p>

<p>“You are not as confident as you were, are you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I am; but we can never be certain, you
know.”</p>

<p>“What is the game, Nick?” asked Chick quietly.</p>

<p>“We will put on our bathing-suits about midnight, I
think,” replied the detective.</p>

<p>“Going to take another swim?” asked Kane.</p>

<p>“Why, yes; I think so; we will if the pirate shows up
around here.”</p>

<p>“Going to swim aboard of him?”</p>

<p>“Just that. If he shows up, I am going aboard of
his boat.”</p>

<p>“And then what?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Events will have to determine that
for me.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to take me with you?”</p>

<p>It was Kane who asked the question, and Nick looked
at him quietly before he replied.</p>

<p>Then he said:</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that, Max. I fancy that we will
get into considerable of a scrap before we get out of
the <i>Shadow</i>, if we get inside of her.”</p>

<p>“All the better. I’m a good man to have around in
a scrap.”</p>

<p>“I know that; but I hardly think that Mrs. Kane would
thank me——”</p>

<p>“Oh, bother Mrs. Kane! I’m with you to a finish in
this thing, Nick. Put your dollars on that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well,” laughed the detective, “I cannot keep you
from following me, if I start once. Only I have got this
to say: If you do follow me, you must obey me as
implicitly as Chick does. From that moment I will be
boss, and if you don’t do as I say, I’ll——”</p>

<p>“Never mind what you’ll do. You won’t have occasion.”</p>

<p>“All right. Now, tell me, which one of all the yachts
anchored here would provide the pirate chief with the
richest haul? Can you tell me that?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes. There isn’t the slightest doubt about the
answer to that question.”</p>

<p>“All the better. If there is no doubt about it, then
the pirate’s information would be as good as ours—eh?
Now, which one fills the bill?”</p>

<p>“The <i>Aurora</i>. She belongs to Sam Kearney, you
know.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“He carries no end of all sorts of priceless things.
He’s got a solid gold dinner set, and all that. Besides,
just now he is entertaining a large party, and there must
be a couple of hundred thousand worth of jewels aboard,
at least.”</p>

<p>“And what about his party? Are they all ashore?”</p>

<p>“Every last one of them. They’ll stay ashore, too.
They always do. Sam is a great fellow for getting up
dinners himself. He likes to cook, and it is one of his
fads to bring his parties here, oust the chef, and do the
cooking for them. He’s doing it now.”</p>

<p>“The whole club knows that, I suppose.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>“The whole world knows it, I imagine. He makes
no bones of it. One of his regrets about my supposed
illness to-night was that I could not eat some new dish
he has learned to prepare, but I told him I was sick
enough as it was. Oh, Sam and his party are booked
for the night, all right.”</p>

<p>“Good!” said Nick. “I think we’ll keep watch over
the <i>Aurora</i>!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">BOARDING THE PIRATE CRUISER.</span></h2>

<p>At midnight the three watchers put on the bathing-suits
which were supplied by Maxwell Kane, and then
seated themselves again on the after-deck, to await
developments.</p>

<p>“What I want to know is, how are we going to carry
any guns with us, with this rig?” asked Kane, as they
seated themselves, and Nick asked Chick if he had
supplied himself with weapons.</p>

<p>“I think that two apiece will be sufficient,” replied
Nick, “and you can easily carry them.”</p>

<p>“But how?”</p>

<p>“In a belt around your body. See? Here is mine,”
and he lifted his belt from another chair. “I shall
buckle that around me before we go into the water.”</p>

<p>“But they will get wet.”</p>

<p>“Sure.”</p>

<p>“Won’t they be useless after that?”</p>

<p>“Hardly. Get yours, and I will load them for you
with my cartridges. You could soak them in water for
a week, and they would do their work just as well after
that.”</p>

<p>For an hour and a half they talked upon random
subjects, but all the time the keen eyes of the detective
never wandered from the water of the cove. He had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
brought his watch on deck with him, and from time to
time he glanced at it.</p>

<p>“It is two o’clock,” he announced, after an unusually
long silence between them. “I think we will make a
move now, if you are ready.”</p>

<p>“Ready,” they each replied.</p>

<p>“Are you a good swimmer, Max?” asked Nick.</p>

<p>“The best that ever was,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“All right. I’m going to take the lead in this affair.
Chick will follow me, and you will follow behind him.”</p>

<p>“All right. Where——”</p>

<p>“You will take your cues from Chick. Whatever you
see him do, you will copy without delay. Understand
that?”</p>

<p>“Yes; it’s plain enough. Where——”</p>

<p>“If he dives, you are to dive, and you are to follow
him under the water wherever he goes. No matter what
he does, you do it, too.”</p>

<p>“I will. Now, confound it, tell me where you are
going?”</p>

<p>“To the <i>Aurora</i>.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t seen any sign of the pirate, have you?
I haven’t.”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Then what makes you so certain that the <i>Aurora</i> is
the place to go?”</p>

<p>“I think, from what you have said, that she is the
yacht which will be the object of attack, if an attack is
made; but, anyhow, her position is much better than
ours. She is farther out and she lies so that she will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
be first in line for attack, even if the pirate has no direct
information about her.”</p>

<p>“But the watch will see us come aboard, and there
will be the devil to pay.”</p>

<p>“I have just told you that you are to do as Chick
and I do; however, I may as well tell you that I am
not going aboard of her.”</p>

<p>“Oh! You are not?”</p>

<p>“Max, there is only one way to capture this pirate
and his ship as well, if he does enter this harbor to-night,
and that is to go aboard of the <i>Shadow</i>.”</p>

<p>“I’m onto that, all right.”</p>

<p>“I shall, therefore, not make the slightest effort to
prevent him and his men from looting the <i>Aurora</i> from
stem to stern, if they care to do so. It will be while
they are up to that trick, or one like it, that we will
get in our fine work.”</p>

<p>“You might as well tell me something about what
that will be before we take to the water. I will be all
the better able to obey orders in that case.”</p>

<p>“Very well; listen.”</p>

<p>“I’m listening.”</p>

<p>“We will swim out to the <i>Aurora</i>. When we get
within a reasonable distance from her, we will dive, and
not come to the surface again until we are under her
chains. In that way we will avoid observation from her
deck.”</p>

<p>“Sure.”</p>

<p>“Fortunately, it is a warm night, and the water is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
quite warm, also, but I don’t think it will be necessary
for us to remain in the water all the time.”</p>

<p>“Thank goodness for that.”</p>

<p>“A yacht like the <i>Aurora</i> is not very well guarded
when she is at anchor in a place of this kind.”</p>

<p>“Huh! I know that only too well.”</p>

<p>“Fortunately, the tide is coming in, and her bow points
toward the open Sound. It will be high and slack in
a couple of hours, so under her bow will be the best
vantage ground for us, and it will be the least-guarded
part of the yacht.”</p>

<p>“I know that. You mean to get aboard of her, don’t
you, and to keep watch from there?”</p>

<p>“If it is practicable, yes.”</p>

<p>The detective buckled his belt around him, and then
let himself carefully down over the side into the water.
His companions did the same, and in another moment
they were swimming silently toward the <i>Aurora</i>.</p>

<p>There was no moon, fortunately, for the weather had
changed into one of those still, but cloudy, nights which
often precede a storm; and yet there was a bright moon
shining somewhere back of the clouds, and sufficient of
its brilliancy penetrated them so that floating objects
upon the water could be seen at a considerable distance.</p>

<p>At a distance of about a cable’s length from the <i>Aurora</i>
the three men disappeared under the water, and they did
not reappear until they were well under the chains of
the <i>Aurora</i>; and there they paused a moment and held
a whispered consultation.</p>

<p>The surface of the cove, and of the Sound out beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
it, was as smooth as glass. There was not a ripple any
where to be seen, and the detective knew that if the pirate
attempted to approach on the surface of the water, his
craft would create a ripple which a close watcher would
surely discover.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if he should approach under the
water, as the detective had no doubt he would do, he
would in all probability observe his previous program,
and come to the surface close under the bow of the vessel
he intended to attack.</p>

<p>“In that case,” he argued, “he will be right where we
want him. But it is too early yet. Wait here until I
climb aboard the <i>Aurora</i>, and if all is clear I will call
you up there, and we will do our waiting on the deck.”</p>

<p>He found that all was clear, and in another moment
the three were together on the deck of Sam Kearney’s
floating palace. After that there followed another period
of waiting, although it was a short one.</p>

<p>Scarcely half an hour had passed when Nick suddenly
seized Chick by the arm and pointed toward a black
object which seemed to be floating on the water, and
which was plainly drifting directly toward them.</p>

<p>“It is the amidships turret,” he whispered. “It is the
only thing about her which shows above the water, and
the man who is doing the steering is doubtless looking
directly at the bow of this yacht; so be careful. He
will discover the slightest motion we make, if we do not
keep well out of sight. Follow me.”</p>

<p>He turned and crawled away on his belly, wriggling
along like a snake, until he was well out of sight behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
the capstan. Then, rising to his knees, he made his
way rapidly to the vessel’s rail and softly let himself
down into the water.</p>

<p>There was not a splash or a sound, and his companions
were equally fortunate.</p>

<p>As soon as the detective was in the water, one stroke
took him a fathom nearer to the bow of the yacht, and
he saw that the pirate craft was swinging silently, as
if she were on a pivot affixed amidships, so that she
would eventually lie directly across the yacht’s bow, but
still with her stem pointed seaward, so that she could
start ahead on the instant, and shoot away out of danger.</p>

<p>“She must be provided with the Kuhnstader propeller
to do that,” he whispered in Kane’s ear. “It is a double
propeller, and the one farthest aft works on a knuckle-joint,
so that it can be made to serve as a rudder as
well as a propeller. And it must be very deep in the
water, too, to work so silently. Come on.”</p>

<p>He sank out of sight in the water, and swam with
powerful strokes toward the stern of the <i>Shadow</i>. He
had noticed how far he would have to go before he
went under the water, and accordingly, when he did rise
to the surface, he was about ten feet, or a trifle more,
abaft of the stern of the vessel.</p>

<p>“See!” he whispered to Kane, who had risen to the
surface close beside him. “Captain Sparkle is already
climbing aboard the <i>Aurora</i>, and I don’t wonder that he
surprised you, Kane, when he paid his visit to you.
There has not been a sound made by his vessel, loud
enough to wake a sleeping dog. You hadn’t a ghost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
of a show. By Jove! but I am anxious to see the interior
of that craft.”</p>

<p>“How are you going to do it?”</p>

<p>“Follow, as I told you, and you will soon see.”</p>

<p>Again he sank beneath the surface, but this time he
was under only a moment, and, when he reappeared, he
was directly abeam of the amidships turret, and his
companions were beside him.</p>

<p>“You see,” he whispered, treading water silently;
“they won’t have occasion to make use of that machine-gun
of theirs to-night, and they know it. In all probability
the amidships turret is unguarded; or even if there
is a man there, his eyes are intently fixed on the <i>Aurora</i>.
He won’t think of trouble from this side. Come on,
now!”</p>

<p>He swam quickly to the side of the vessel.</p>

<p>She was so low in the water that it was an easy matter
for them to reach and seize hold of the rail which
has already been described. In another moment the three
men had hauled themselves aboard of the <i>Shadow</i>, and
then, gliding along like so many shadows themselves,
they passed through the open turret into the interior of
the pirate cruiser.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE PIRATE CHIEFTAIN UNMASKED.</span></h2>

<p>The interior of the turret was as dark as a pocket, but
the detective quickly discovered the door which communicated
with the interior of the vessel proper, and
he opened it. Contrary to his expectations, he found
himself then inside a brilliantly lighted section of the
vessel, which he recognized at a glance to be the general
assembling-room—the apartment used by the pirates for
their general uses.</p>

<p>It was, in fact, in the form of a miniature social hall
of a great steamship, and even the detective was amazed
to see the sumptuousness with which it was furnished
and decorated. It might have done service as a compartment
in the palace of a prince, so perfect were its
appointments. But the thing which interested the detective
most just then was the fact that there was not
a human being to be seen, not a sign of one, beyond
the general significance of the place itself.</p>

<p>“Come!” he whispered. “It will never do for us to
remain here. They will be bringing their spoils aboard
presently, and we must be well concealed before that
time.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to remain here?” asked Kane also
in a whisper.</p>

<p>“Sure! What do you suppose I took all that trouble
to get here for?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, to have it out with the pirate—to have a scrap
with him at once, capture his ship and cargo, and all
that.”</p>

<p>“We will do that later. Just now we have other axes
to grind.”</p>

<p>He glided rapidly aft toward a door he saw in the
bulkhead, opened it cautiously, and peered through. But
instantly he started back, and, seizing Chick and Kane
with either hand, forced them underneath the long table
behind them.</p>

<p>And they were not a moment too soon. The door
which he had partially opened was thrown wide ajar
this time, and a woman appeared on the threshold. She
paused there for a moment, and the detective, from his
position under the table, could see her plainly.</p>

<p>His mental comment at that moment was that it would
not do to say that she was beautiful, merely because her
face was too strong for that adjective; but she was certainly
handsome. She was tall and well formed, and
her hair and eyes were as black as night, while her skin
was as white as that which you often see on people with
red hair.</p>

<p>For a moment she stood there in the doorway, while
her great, round, black eyes took in every detail of the
cabin she was surveying.</p>

<p>“I surely thought I heard somebody here,” Nick heard
her murmur. “Doubtless it was one of the men.”</p>

<p>Again she looked around her searchingly. Then she
turned, and seemed to study the room she had quitted,
as if she were undecided what to do; but, after a moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
of hesitation, she came into the room where Nick and
his companions were concealed under the table, closed
the door after her, and walked rapidly through toward
the turret door by which the detective had effected an
entrance.</p>

<p>Nick changed his position so that he could watch her,
and he saw that she hesitated again at the turret door;
but it was at once evident that her curiosity was too
much for her judgment, for, after an instant, she pushed
the door open in front of her, and disappeared through
it, closing it behind her.</p>

<p>“Now is our opportunity,” said Nick. “Quick! Follow
me!”</p>

<p>He darted from under the table, glided rapidly toward
the door through which the woman had first made her
appearance, and in an instant, followed by Chick and
Kane, passed through into the after-cabin of the vessel.</p>

<p>And if the other one was sumptuous in its appointments,
this one put it entirely in the shade. It was
veritably a palace—the palace of a queen, too; but evidently
of a queen who was provided with a prince consort,
for there were many evidences about of masculine
uses.</p>

<p>There were cigarettes and cigars upon the table in the
center of the room. There was a piano built into the
bulkhead at one end of it. There was an electric drop
light burning on the table, and there were comfortable
chairs, books, papers, periodicals, and articles of various
kinds and uses scattered about everywhere.</p>

<p>At one side of the center-table there was a chess-stand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
with the ivory men in such a position as to indicate that
a game had been interrupted in order that the <i>Aurora</i>
might be looted; and there were pictures and hangings
and other decorations in the compartment, which showed
that it was the abode of refinement, as well as of a
pirate.</p>

<p>All these things the detective noticed in his first searching
glance around him.</p>

<p>“That woman was afraid to go outside, for some reason,”
he said to the others. “She did not wish the captain
of this craft to see her, and so it follows that she
won’t be gone more than a minute or two; but there must
be another cabin aft of this one—at least, there is sure
to be a couple of staterooms.”</p>

<p>He started forward as he spoke, and, pushing aside
a hanging drapery, found himself in a narrow gangway,
or passage, with an open door of a stateroom on either
side of him. But a glance told him that these were the
rooms occupied by the two people he most wished to
avoid until he had heard enough of what they might
have to say to each other to determine him how to act.</p>

<p>Beyond these, however, there were other doors—two
of them—and, as before, one on either side. These were
closed, and he decided at once that they were not in
constant use. He opened one of them at the same time
that he pointed toward the other.</p>

<p>“Go in there,” he directed, and so it happened that
Chick and Kane went together into one of the rooms,
while Nick found himself alone in the remaining one.</p>

<p>And then, just as he pulled the door shut behind him—that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
is, he closed it all but the merest crack—the noise
of the opening and closing of the door of the outer
cabin apprised him of the fact that the woman had returned.</p>

<p>He supposed that she would return to the table and
seat herself there, while she awaited the return of the
pirate chief from his expedition aboard the <i>Aurora</i>; but
in that he was mistaken. He was peering through the
crack left him by not quite closing his own door, and
he could see past an aperture at the side of the portière
at the end of the passage that the woman was coming
straight toward it.</p>

<p>He watched her without moving.</p>

<p>He hoped that she would not come to his door, or
visit that of the room in which his companions had
taken refuge, but he was thoroughly prepared to receive
her if she should do either the one thing or the other.</p>

<p>The detective had seen enough already to make him
wish to see and hear much more. The mere capture
of the pirate vessel and those who were aboard of her
was now not sufficient to satisfy him, for he realized
that he would then have only a part of the explanation
of the unheard-of circumstance of a pirate roaming the
waters of Long Island Sound.</p>

<p>On the other hand, he figured that if he could remain
where he was a sufficient length of time without discovery
there might be an opportunity for a complete investigation—or,
at least, that he would hear enough of
conversation between the pirate chief and the woman to
inform him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>“But,” he thought to himself, “there must somewhere
be a port for this vessel. She must have some place
somewhere, to lay by and rest, and to permit her crew
to rest. I hardly suppose that she goes to the bottom of
the Sound and rests there, and it is certain that she could
not visit a frequented port without attracting attention
which would be fatal. Therefore, she must go somewhere.
She must have a port; and, in all likelihood, she
will go directly to that port when she leaves the vicinity
of this harbor.</p>

<p>“Now, if she does go to such a place, it is more than
likely that the pirate and his wife—or whatever she is to
him—will go ashore, and that is, the opportunity I want.
Just give me half an hour of undisturbed opportunity
aboard this vessel, and I will read every secret its owner
ever had. Ah!”</p>

<p>All these thoughts passed through his brain while he
was watching the woman’s approach, and the concluding
exclamation he uttered—or thought, for he made no
sound—was caused by her hastening directly to the door
behind which he was concealed.</p>

<p>Just outside of it she came to an abrupt halt, and the
detective drew back and flattened himself as closely as
possible against the bulkhead, in order that if she did
decide to enter the stateroom where he was concealed,
he might remain undiscovered for as long a time as
possible.</p>

<p>But whatever the thoughts were which troubled her,
and gave rise to the hesitation under which she seemed
to be struggling, they were of short duration; for, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
she stretched out her hand until it touched the
door, she withdrew it again, and then, after sighing
deeply, turned and retraced her steps to the cabin.</p>

<p>The detective opened his door again, and stepped out
far enough into the passageway to discover that the
woman had resumed the reading of a book, which had
been left lying open on the table, and he decided that in
all probability she would not leave her chair again for
some time to come; at least, not until the work of the
pirates in looting the <i>Aurora</i> was finished and the chief
returned to the cabin and to her. Satisfied on that point,
and perceiving that the woman’s back was toward him,
he went inside the cabin in which he had taken refuge,
and without hesitation turned on the electric light.</p>

<p>He believed this to be as good a time as any in which
to search the cabin in which he found himself, and he
had already perceived that, although it was one which
did not appear to be permanently occupied, it nevertheless,
bore evidences of individual uses.</p>

<p>He knew, also, that he ran no apparent danger in turning
on the light for a few moments, since the woman’s
back was toward him, and he was positive that the door
beyond her, which communicated with the waist of the
vessel, could not be opened without his hearing it.</p>

<p>The stateroom was in every way as commodious as
possible in the narrow space allowed, and everything
within it had been arranged by a master hand, with a
view to comfort and convenience.</p>

<p>The berth itself was a bed; in the bulkhead at one end
had been built a rosewood dresser, and at the other end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
a writing-desk. There was a folding Morris chair, also
fashioned so that it could be made to disappear in the
bulkhead, under the electric light; there was a narrow
and shallow wardrobe close beside the dresser, and a
steamer trunk showed its front under the edge of the
narrow bed.</p>

<p>Nick took in all these things at a glance, and with one
step he approached the dresser.</p>

<p>The opening of the top drawer revealed an assorted
collection of a gentleman’s collars, cuffs, ties, handkerchiefs,
et cetera. The second drawer was filled with
shirts; the third and last, with an assortment of underclothing.</p>

<p>He took all this into account in one rapid survey, but it
was a handkerchief on top of its fellows which chiefly
attracted his attention, and which nearly caused him to
utter an exclamation of surprise as well as satisfaction.
The handkerchief had been folded so that the marked
corner was uppermost, and the detective saw at a glance
that it bore a crest, and that underneath it were the
initials “J. de C.”</p>

<p>That was a discovery worth while, he thought, but he
closed the drawers quickly and crossed the stateroom to
the writing-desk. In an instant he had opened that, and
in another he was holding a sheet of writing-paper in
his hand upon which was embossed the same crest, and
the words “Château de Cadillac, Anjou, France.”</p>

<p>“So,” he mused, as he returned it to its place and
closed the desk, “I have here a full and complete explanation
of the mystery. My theory about the family characteristics<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
and traits was the correct one, after all, for
there is no doubt now in my mind that the chief of these
pirates, the master of the <i>Shadow</i>, Captain Sparkle by
name, is closely related to Jean, the Count of Cadillac—probably
a brother.”</p>

<p>He was in the act of reclosing the desk, when he heard
the sound of an opening door proceeding from the cabin,
and he hastily extinguished the electric light and resorted
again to the aperture he had left in closing the door, so
that he might see all that took place in the apartment
beyond.</p>

<p>And then, as he gazed past the portières, he saw the
erect figure of the pirate chief as he entered the cabin,
arrayed in his Hamletesque costume of red; and he saw
him raise his right hand, and with one gesture remove
the hat and wig of blond hair from his head; and the
detective could scarcely refrain from uttering an exclamation,
for the pirate chieftain stood revealed, a perfect
counterpart of Count Cadillac!</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />
<span class="smaller">TWO COUNTS OF CADILLAC.</span></h2>

<p>“If I did not know positively that Count Cadillac is
at this moment ashore at the club-house, I would be willing
to swear that he stands before me yonder,” was the
detective’s mental comment, as he gazed upon the transformation
wrought by the mere removal of the hat and
wig worn by the pirate chief. “As it is, there can be no
doubt now that my first idea was the correct one, and
that the two men are brothers—aye, twin brothers, at
that.”</p>

<p>“Well?” asked the woman of the pirate, permitting the
book to rest upon her lap and raising her eyes to his
face. She spoke in French, and he replied to her in the
same tongue; but it was all perfectly intelligible to Nick
Carter.</p>

<p>“It is magnificent,” he replied, throwing himself into a
chair opposite her, and selecting a cigar, which he proceeded
to light with evident relish. “It is much better
than I ever dared to hope, from one affair.”</p>

<p>“Affair!” said the woman, with cold contempt in her
voice and manner. “Why dignify your thieving operations
by the use of such a word? Why not call them
what they are?”</p>

<p>Sparkle shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Calm yourself, Hortense,” he said, puffing lazily at
his cigar. “A few more expeditions like this one to-night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
will render us independent. Before the season is ended,
if I continue as fortunate as I have been so far, we will
have collected a million, at least—perhaps two millions;
and dollars, too! Think of it! That seems between five
and ten million francs. Why, do you know, petite, that
Alexandre Dumas only gave the Count of Monte Cristo
something like ten million francs, altogether?”</p>

<p>The woman sighed.</p>

<p>“But it is robbery,” she said—“robbery! There is no
gentler term to apply to it. You call it making collections.
You describe your piratical expeditions as ‘affairs,’
and you refer to our trips when we start out to
accomplish this infamous work as ‘excursions.’ But they
are not excursions, Jules!”</p>

<p>He waived his right hand deprecatingly.</p>

<p>“Whatever they may be, they are none the less necessary,”
he said coolly. “I will thank you to regard them
so, Hortense. Think of our estates in France. Think
of the opportunities which will be afforded you over there
for doing unlimited good with the wealth I shall secure
for you. Think——”</p>

<p>“Bah! Think! I do nothing else but think! I think
all the time. I remember that my family was one which
no stain had touched until I married you, and you
dragged me into this thievish business! I remember that,
although we were poor, we were proud of an illustrious
past, than which nobody in France could boast a better.
I remember——”</p>

<p>“Enough! I will not hear you!”</p>

<p>“And how long, pray, must this continue before you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
will consider that you have enough to pay your debts
and to live on the income of what is left to you after
that of your stolen fortune?”</p>

<p>“How long? Who knows! As I have said, if other
affairs prosper me as well as this one to-night has done,
it will not be long. Think of it! To-night—to-night
alone—I have collected almost a quarter of a million, in
the value of dollars! To-night I have added to my store
more than a million francs!”</p>

<p>“Aye; but much of it you will never be able to use.”</p>

<p>“I shall use it all. The melting-pot is ever handy; and
there are other means of disposing of——”</p>

<p>“What, for example, shall you do with the trophy cups
you have taken from some of your victims?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“Ah!” he replied. “They are valuable! Very valuable!
I have thought out a method by which their owners
can be induced to redeem them for cash at much
more than their value and without danger to me. That
Monsieur Kane, for example—he would gladly give fifty
thousand dollars rather than lose his cups—his petted
race cups. And what is fifty thousand dollars to him?
Faugh! It is nothing! He would think no more of that
amount than I do of the ash of this cigar, which I throw
from me—so. And Monsieur Burton—oui, oui! With
him it is the same. Fifty thousand? He would give a
hundred thousand, so Jean tells me. And he is not as
rich as Monsieur Kane! But his trophies are dearer to
him. And to-night? To-night I have collected others.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
Ha, Hortense! It is the millennium that is at hand for
us!”</p>

<p>“The millennium!” she exclaimed scornfully. “Say,
rather, it is Cayenne, Toulon, the Château d’If, the Bastile,
or the guillotine!”</p>

<p>The pirate shrugged his shoulders resignedly.</p>

<p>“You mentioned Jean,” continued the woman. “Tell
me, what of him?”</p>

<p>“What of him? What should there be of him? He
is invaluable. But for the information he gives me I
could not accomplish what I do; I could have accomplished
nothing of what I have already done. And he
is innocent of real wrong, is he not? He tells me, merely,
‘To-morrow evening Monsieur Kane will anchor at such
a place with his yacht, the <i>Goalong</i>. I shall be a guest.’
It is enough. He says no more than that. If I appear
upon the scene and demand tribute, Jean is not to blame.
Again he says to me, ‘Monsieur Burton is fond of running
his yacht, the <i>Harkaway</i>, through the Sound by
night, when the moon is full. He likes to go at half-speed.
I should not be surprised if he left Newport soon
after we do so, and I am quite sure that he will be due
at that same anchorage where we are going the evening
following our arrival.’ You see, Hortense, that is merely
a comment. If I take advantage of the knowledge thus
acquired, it is no fault of Jean’s, is it?”</p>

<p>“Bah!” she exclaimed. “Such arguments! Sophistry!
Lies!”</p>

<p>“Well? And then what? In Anjou we have our estates—Jean
and I. When he is away, I am there. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
I am there, he is not. Even our own people do not understand
that there are two men who are so much alike that
one cannot be separated from the other by strange eyes.
And who, in the end, shall have it to say that the Count
of Cadillac was ever a pirate? Surely, not the American
millionaires who have entertained him; surely not
those men who have seen him seated beside them on
their own decks while the pirate was engaged in looting
their treasures. And when I have collected the five
or ten million francs and taken them to France—when
the fortunes of the Cadillacs are reestablished, and one
or the other of us seems suddenly to reappear from far-away
Peru with a story about fabulous mines owned
there, which have yielded the fortune so suddenly in evidence,
who will there be to say that once there was a
<i>Shadow</i> on the water—a pirate, if you will—which collected
this fortune for the twin brothers so happily
reunited after a separation which has endured since childhood?
Ah, Hortense, it is well planned. It is well
schemed. It is perfect!”</p>

<p>The woman was quietly weeping now, and did not
reply. Seeing that it was so, he left his seat and passed
around the table to her side.</p>

<p>“I am sorry, petite,” he said sadly. “It is robbery, I
know. But it is robbery of millionaires, who will never
miss what is taken from them.”</p>

<p>He would have caressed her, but she repulsed him.</p>

<p>“No,” she said. “Leave me. I do not know even if
you are Jules. You may be Jean. When one of you
is beside me I never know which one it is. It is only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
when you approach me together, side by side, that I know
which is my husband. And you can change places with
each other so deftly that I never know when you do it.
Return to your chair. Remain there until you go to
your room.”</p>

<p>He laughed uneasily; but he obeyed her, and returned
to his chair at the opposite side of the table.</p>

<p>Nick Carter witnessed this scene with varying emotions,
and behind him in the passageway he knew that
Chick and Kane were both standing, as deeply interested
as he was. He was thinking that somewhere about the
craft there were at least seven more men. No doubt they
were forward in their own quarters. Perhaps they were
in that general assembly-room.</p>

<p>The detective knew now that it was merely a question
of opportunity when he would capture the pirate cruiser
and all the men aboard of her. The game was in his
own hands now, and he merely desired to hold back his
trumps until the final play, in order to surprise his opponent
the more.</p>

<p>The <i>Shadow</i> was by this time passing swiftly through
the water. He knew that, because he could hear the
rustling of the passing ripples along the smooth sides of
the hull. But there was no motion to the craft at all.
There was no jar made by machinery. The cruiser went
along as silently, as swiftly, and as smoothly as if she had
been a phantom.</p>

<p>He wondered where she was going—where the vessel
was taking him and his friends—but he had no means of
determining that question until she should arrive at her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
destination—until the hatches should be opened, and there
should be an effort made on the part of the officers and
crew to go on deck. But he hoped that such a time was
approaching, and he believed it was, inasmuch as neither
of the occupants of the cabin seemed to think of retiring.
It was evident to him that they were both awaiting the
arrival of the vessel at some port where she was expected
to lay by and rest until the time came for her to start
again upon another of her “collecting excursions.”</p>

<p>Presently, Captain Sparkle left his chair, and the detective
drew back hastily, thinking that perhaps he intended
to seek his room. But he was undeceived.</p>

<p>“We must be approaching our anchorage,” he said. “It
is time I went to the wheel. I dare not trust Toto to
take us inside the screen.”</p>

<p>The woman made no reply, and he left the cabin, going
forward through that other cabin by which Nick and his
friends had entered the vessel.</p>

<p>When he was gone, the woman did not move.</p>

<p>She remained where he had left her, with her head
bowed upon her hand, and Nick turned to Chick and
made a number of pantomimic gestures, which were
plainly read by his assistant. They told him as plainly
as words could have done that his chief wished him to
approach the woman silently from behind, and to seize
her, and hold her, so that she could not move. At the
same time he was to wrap a towel tightly around her
face, so that it would cover her mouth, and thus prevent
her from crying out, and so giving an alarm.</p>

<p>Chick obeyed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>He crept forward silently, and the woman was not
aware of his approach until he had thrown the towel
across her lips and drawn it tightly against them. And
then, while she struggled, trying in vain to escape, Nick
Carter stepped in front of her, and said, quietly, and
in the French language:</p>

<p>“Be calm, madame. You are in no danger, and you
shall not suffer the slightest harm, I assure you.”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE CAPTURE OF THE PIRATE CHIEF.</span></h2>

<p>“This is not precisely the costume in which I should
have preferred to present myself to you, madame,” continued
the detective, with a smile. “Bathing-suits were
necessary, under the circumstances, inasmuch as we were
obliged to swim out to the <i>Shadow</i> in order to get aboard
of her at all. And, in order to relieve your mind, I will
tell you how we did it: We came aboard at the moment
when your husband—or his brother, for, like yourself, I
have no idea which one of the Counts of Cadillac the
gentleman who has just left you happens to be—followed
by his men, boarded the <i>Aurora</i>. After that we hid beneath
the table in the adjoining cabin while you went
forward. When you did that, we came in here; and you
know the rest.</p>

<p>“Now, madame, I dislike exceedingly to inconvenience
you, but I must ask you to point out to me which is your
own stateroom, and you must go into it, and remain there
until the remainder of our work is done. That work,
as you no doubt guess, is to capture the captain and crew
of this vessel.</p>

<p>“I know that you are not a pirate in your sympathies
any more than you are in fact, and I can assure you that
you have nothing to dread personally. I overheard your
conversation with Captain Sparkle just now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>“You cannot answer me, so I will continue as though
you had done so.</p>

<p>“We do not wish to be disturbed in the work we have
to do, and you must not be permitted to give an alarm.
Now, there are two ways to prevent you from doing so;
one is to force that towel inside your jaws, and so to
gag you so that you cannot cry out; but that would be
an indignity which I dislike to commit. The other is to
accept your word that you will not attempt to cry out,
or in any way to communicate an alarm to any person
on this vessel while you are inside that room. I am
sure if you give your word you will keep it, for I have
just heard you state that the honor of your own family
is your greatest solicitude. Chick, you may take away the
towel. Now, madame, will you make me the promise
I require?”</p>

<p>“I will,” she replied at once, “if you will permit me
to go to my room and to lock myself inside.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. Will you promise me that you will make
no effort to leave that room until some other person releases
you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, monsieur.”</p>

<p>“Very good. Stand back, Chick.”</p>

<p>The woman rose and turned away without a word.
They watched her cross the cabin and enter her room,
and then heard the click of the lock as she closed the
door.</p>

<p>“I am sorry for that woman, Carter,” said Maxwell
Kane.</p>

<p>“So am I. She is the victim of circumstances, like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
many another woman in the world, who meets with censure
because of the faults of the man she loves. And
now, since there is no doubt that we have sufficient time,
for the vessel has not slowed down yet, and, therefore,
the captain cannot return here for some time to come,
I suggest that we make use of some of the wardrobe
possessed by these gentlemen who own this craft, and get
out of these wet bathing-suits. Come.”</p>

<p>When the three emerged again from the passageway
into the cabin there were broad smiles on the faces of
Maxwell Kane and Chick when they saw Nick Carter,
and not without reason.</p>

<p>He had directed Kane to enter the stateroom into which
he had himself first dodged, at the beginning of this last
scene, and had selected for his own uses the one which
was directly opposite that in which the woman had locked
herself.</p>

<p>He believed that to be the room belonging to Captain
Sparkle, and in that he was not mistaken. A short
search among the effects of the room discovered to him
another complete suit of the favorite costume of the pirate
chieftain, blond wig and all, and he lost no time in
arraying himself in them. True, there was no mustache
and imperial with which to adorn his features, but neither
was there need of them, since the red mask was there.</p>

<p>And thus it happened that when he returned to the
cabin, where Kane and Chick were already awaiting him,
he looked exactly as Captain Sparkle had appeared at
the time when he so silently boarded the deck of the
<i>Goalong</i> and looted the yacht.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now, Nick,” said Kane impatiently, “what next?”</p>

<p>“Wait,” replied the detective.</p>

<p>“Confound it! that is your inevitable reply, Carter,
whenever I ask a question.”</p>

<p>“Well, it is usually the correct one. If Captain Sparkle
returns to this cabin before he docks or anchors the
<i>Shadow</i>, we will capture him at once, but I don’t think
he will do that. Hark! The vessel is slowing down already.
She has stopped. There! Do you feel that tremble
through her? She is backing. And now the propeller
has stopped. Good! There is a slight jar, probably
made by the hull coming in contact with piling, or
something like it. And there is the scraping noise she
makes while she glides along against it. We have arrived,
my friends. In a very few moments Captain Sparkle
will be here.”</p>

<p>“Good!” said Kane. “I, for one, am becoming impatient.”</p>

<p>“Oblige me, both of you, by stepping into the passage,
behind the portière, and you will not have to wait much
longer.”</p>

<p>They did as requested, and Nick at once dropped into
the chair which the captain of the pirate cruiser had so
lately occupied.</p>

<p>And he did not have long to wait.</p>

<p>Ten minutes passed, and then the detective heard the
sound of approaching steps along the deck of the outer
cabin, and a moment later the door was thrown ajar, and
Captain Sparkle stepped into the compartment and closed
it behind him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>He did not perceive Nick until he was well inside the
room, and then, for an instant, he stood rooted to the
spot where he was, as if his powers of motion had suddenly
become paralyzed by what he saw before him. But
the detective did not move.</p>

<p>He had raised his revolver when the pirate passed
through the door, and the first intimation that Sparkle
had of his presence was when he discovered an image
of himself, seated in his own chair, and found that he
was covered by a revolver in the grasp of that image.</p>

<p>“What sort of fool’s play is this, Hortense?” he demanded,
then. And at the same instant he took a step
nearer.</p>

<p>It was at once plain that he supposed that the woman,
during his short absence, had attempted this masquerade,
but he was quickly undeceived.</p>

<p>“I am not Hortense,” replied Nick calmly. “Neither
am I Captain Sparkle, although I do not doubt that I
resemble him. Stand back, Mister Pirate, if you value
your life! You are my prisoner! Chick!” he added.
“Kane! Come here!”</p>

<p>If Sparkle had for an instant thought of throwing himself
upon this daring intruder, he controlled himself. The
sudden appearance of two other men upon the scene convinced
him that this was no time for resistance, and he
shrugged his shoulders with the utmost nonchalance, apparently,
while Chick glided between him and the door
through which he had entered, and Kane backed off to
the opposite side of the cabin, and also covered him with
a revolver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>“Which of the two Counts of Cadillac are you—Jules,
or Jean?” asked Nick, still retaining his seat in the chair,
but removing the mask from his face and holding it in
his disengaged hand.</p>

<p>The pirate smiled cynically. He wore no mask, nor
was there a sign of a frown upon his handsome face.</p>

<p>“Really, monsieur,” he replied, “we are so much alike
that we frequently have difficulty in determining the answer
to that question ourselves. You do not believe it?
No? It is quite true, I assure you. You see, I am Jean
as often as I am Jules, and Jules as often as I am Jean.
What will you have, eh? I am both. I am neither.”</p>

<p>“At all events you are Captain Sparkle, the pirate.”</p>

<p>“Ah, monsieur! Am I, indeed? I might say the same
of you.”</p>

<p>“How many men have you aboard this craft?”</p>

<p>“Since an hour ago, monsieur, I have not counted them.
I really do not remember.”</p>

<p>Chick was standing behind the pirate, and now Nick
Carter gave him a signal which the assistant perfectly
understood. He suddenly stepped forward and seized
Captain Sparkle’s arms, drawing them closely together
behind his body, and while he held them there the detective
rose from his chair and tossed a coil of small rope
toward Kane.</p>

<p>“I found it in the stateroom,” he said. “Hold him,
Kane, while Chick binds him with it.”</p>

<p>They bound his arms tightly together behind his back.
Next they seated him in one of the chairs, and tied him
there so securely that it was impossible for him to move,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
and then they drew back and regarded their work with
satisfaction. Nick left his chair now, and stood in front
of the pirate; and the latter, still with the utmost calmness,
asked:</p>

<p>“Might I be permitted to inquire what disposition you
have made of Madame Cadillac?”</p>

<p>“She is locked in her stateroom,” replied Nick. “She
has not been harmed.”</p>

<p>For a moment after that the pirate was silent, and then,
with the first show of sincerity he had manifested since
the beginning of the interview, he said:</p>

<p>“Monsieur, I do not know who or what you are, but I
suspect that you are in some manner connected with the
police. If that is true, I wish to assure you that, no matter
how guilty you may find me to be concerning certain
events which have happened in this locality, she, Madame
Cadillac, is entirely innocent.”</p>

<p>“I quite believe you,” replied Nick.</p>

<p>“Thank you, monsieur.”</p>

<p>“And now, will you add to that statement some further
information that I desire?” asked the detective.</p>

<p>“No. I will tell you nothing. You seem to be quite
competent to manage your own affairs. I do not even ask
you how you got here, although I am extremely curious
to know; but I suspect that you must have swum aboard
while the <i>Shadow</i> was——”</p>

<p>“Lying across the bows of the <i>Aurora</i>. Exactly. You
have guessed it.”</p>

<p>“It was a daring thing to do, monsieur; and there is
still a more daring one ahead of you, for while I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
been seated here I have been able to press with my foot
an electric button which communicates with an alarm
at the forward part of the vessel. Its constant ringing
has brought my men to me on the run. They are at the
door. They are here! In a moment I will be free, and
you will be prisoners! Ah!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE FIGHT IN THE PIRATE’S CABIN.</span></h2>

<p>Although the words of warning uttered by the pirate
were deliberate and emphatic, there was not a sound while
he was speaking them to denote that they were true.
Nevertheless, he had spoken the truth; and he had gaged
the moment of interruption so exactly that even as he
ceased speaking the door which communicated with the
outer cabin was burst open, and three men, followed by
several others, leaped in upon them.</p>

<p>But short as was the warning, short as was the time
of preparation on the part of the detective and his companions,
they were none the less prepared.</p>

<p>The foremost of the men who entered the cabin thus
unceremoniously was a giant in stature, and Nick saw at a
glance that he could not be one of the members of the
regular crew, since no mention had been made to him of
a person of such gigantic proportions. And here it was
that the detective gained a momentary advantage, by reason
of the fact that he had arrayed himself in the costume
of the pirate chieftain; and it was that moment of
time which brought about the final result.</p>

<p>When the giant burst into the room he beheld two individuals
who seemed to him to be his chief. One was
seated upon a chair, to which he was tightly bound; the
other was almost directly in front of him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>For one instant he halted, dismayed, not knowing what
to do.</p>

<p>But Captain Sparkle cried out to him from his chair—a
quick command in French, which was as serviceable
to the giant as a full and complete explanation could
have been. Nevertheless, that instant of hesitation worked
his ruin, for, although it was only instantaneous, it still
afforded the detective time to gather himself for the attack.</p>

<p>As the giant sprang toward him. Nick stooped and
darted past his guard, under his extended arms, and he
seized him around his massive body in a grip as powerful
as the giant himself could have exerted. They were
oddly matched, these two. The giant towered over the
detective like a Goliath over a David. The scene had
the appearance of a full-grown man fighting with a half-grown
boy.</p>

<p>But the giant was, nevertheless, lifted bodily from his
feet, and he hung there, struggling vainly to touch his
toes or his heels to the deck, for, like certain animals we
know about, his defensive powers were fruitless if he
could not get his feet to the ground.</p>

<p>He bellowed like a bull at first, until the pressure of
Nick’s powerful arms squeezed him into silence. He
swung his arms about him like the blades of a windmill,
and he kicked frantically with his feet in an effort to
bring the detective down. His huge, animallike face
turned red, then purple, then black. Blood oozed from
his nostrils and mouth; and then, like the snapping of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
whip in the distance, his ribs cracked under the awful
pressure which Nick put upon them.</p>

<p>Instantly his hold upon the detective relaxed; his flaying
arms dropped to his sides, useless; he gasped, and
then, as Nick released him, he fell in a heap to the floor
of the cabin, uttering howl after howl of rage and anguish.
Like all brutes of gigantic strength, once conquered,
he could fight no more, and he remained where he
had fallen, moaning, helpless, whipped—and whipped into
a bleeding mass of flesh by the mere pressure of the great
detective’s muscular arms.</p>

<p>Then Nick turned like a flash toward the others.</p>

<p>Five of the attacking party were down and out, laid
where they were by the hammering fists of Maxwell Kane
and Chick, for there had been no time or opportunity to
make use of their revolvers, which happened to be inside
their pockets when the onslaught occurred. Four more
men were pressing the two fighters into one corner of
the cabin, and were almost at the point of getting the
upper hand of them, when Nick rushed to their assistance.</p>

<p>But the fighting powers of the pirates was short-lived
after that happened.</p>

<p>Nick Carter’s fist caught one of them under the ear;
another went down from a blow against the side of his
jaw; a third was knocked squarely into Chick’s arms by a
kick in the small of his back from Nick’s foot, and the
fourth, dismayed by what was happening around him, lost
his head just long enough to give Kane an opening, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
he received a well-directed blow on the end of his nose
which finished him.</p>

<p>The fight was over, and there was no remnant of one
left in any of the men who had entered that cabin so
bravely to capture Nick Carter and his friends. There
had been ten in all, against three; but now those ten
men were bound and speedily rendered helpless, and the
three stood over them, comparatively uninjured.</p>

<p>It is true that Kane wore a discolored lump on his right
cheek, and that Chick was nursing the knuckles of his
right hand tenderly; but otherwise they were uninjured.</p>

<p>And all this time Captain Sparkle had been compelled
to sit idly by, a spectator of the downfall of his followers.
However, when Nick Carter looked toward him he
was smiling.</p>

<p>“Well, captain,” said the detective, “what do you think
about being free now?”</p>

<p>“I think,” replied the pirate, with a broader smile, “that
the moment will have to be postponed because of unavoidable
circumstances.”</p>

<p>“Quite right,” said the detective.</p>

<p>The ten men captured by the detective, assisted by
Maxwell Kane and Chick, proved to be the entire complement
of the pirate crew; they included every man who
acted under the orders of Captain Sparkle.</p>

<p>Seven of these comprised the crew of the <i>Shadow</i> and
three were those who remained on shore at the strange
harbor where she was in the habit of lying by, out of the
sight and the ken of the world at large.</p>

<p>And this harbor was a strange one, indeed. It lies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
considerably to the eastward of Hempstead Bay, and any
one of those who read can readily discover the spot if
he will take the trouble to journey there.</p>

<p>There is a place where boulders and rocks and reefs jut
out of the water at low tide, capped at the outer end of
the fringe by one huge one, so that the general appearance
of the formation has led the residents along the
shore near there to name them the Sow and Pigs. Between
these two projections of rocks is a deep and narrow
way, through which a vessel built after the model of
the <i>Shadow</i> may pass at certain conditions of the tides.</p>

<p>At the base of it, or against the shore, it dips into the
bluff somewhat more than a hundred feet, with a high
sand-bank on either side; a barren, abrupt, precipitous
bank fringed by stunted verdure, which grows down almost
to the water’s edge.</p>

<p>It was here that the detective discovered the <i>Shadow</i> to
be moored. An excavation had been made in the bank on
one side, and within it were found the effects taken from
the <i>Goalong</i> and the <i>Harkaway</i>; on board the cruiser, of
course, were still all the articles stolen from the <i>Aurora</i>.</p>

<p>And the pirate craft—the <i>Shadow</i>?</p>

<p>She was all that has been claimed for her. She had
herself been stolen from her builders in France, at the
very time when she was about to be delivered to a Russian
prince, for whom she had been built. Operated by
electricity, derived from storage batteries, which were
supplied by a charging dynamo so that she never ran
out of power, she was fleet and powerful, and half a
submarine; that is, she could sink and rise again without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
remaining for a long time immersed; and she could skim
swiftly along the surface of the water with only her turrets
showing above it.</p>

<p>Madame Cadillac did not follow her husband to prison.
She returned to France, a sadder and a much wiser
woman. The count—he who was called Jean—disappeared
from the club-house that night.</p>

<p>It was thought that he had somehow discovered the absence
of Kane and the detective from the <i>Goalong</i>, and
that he decided that it would be good policy to decamp.
At all events, that is what he did do.</p>

<p>“Too bad!” murmured Nick. “That fellow will be up
to mischief yet.”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE ROVER OF THE SEAS.</span></h2>

<p>It was a month later. The <i>Goalong</i> was six hours out
of Hamilton, Bermuda, bound for Newport News. The
time was something after six o’clock in the evening, and
the sun had just sunk below the horizon, thirteen miles
away. The season was the first week in September—a
month during which few if any tourists ever think of
visiting the Bermudas.</p>

<p>But Maxwell Kane had for many years been in the
habit of spending a week or two of the summer season
in Hamilton, because having, on one occasion, visited the
place by accident at that time of the year, he had discovered
that the statement frequently made by the permanent
residents of the place that Bermuda was much
pleasanter in the summer than in the winter was true.</p>

<p>Ever since that knowledge was impressed upon him
he had not lost a season of rest there, away from the
hurly-burly of New York, away from the heat of Gotham,
which is infinitely greater than among the islands—but,
above all, away from people.</p>

<p>This particular day had been one of exceptional beauty,
and the evening promised to excel it. The ocean was as
nearly calm as it ever is, and only the long, heavy rollers,
which seafaring men have named “dead swells,” suggested
that such things as violent storms ever visited that
portion of the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>And these swells were so far apart, so regular in their
motion and so devoid of even a ripple to mar their mirror-like
aspect, that the yacht seemed scarcely to feel them at
all, but met them and sailed over them with the grace
and ease of a living thing.</p>

<p>Seated under the awning on the after-deck were four
people, three of whom were women, for Maxwell Kane
had left men out of his plans for that trip. He liked to
take his annual trip to Bermuda without men of his own
class around him; and so it happened that the passengers
aboard his yacht numbered merely his wife, his wife’s
sister, who was Miss Bessie Harlan, and Mrs. Starkweather,
who was their mother.</p>

<p>“I do not see why you do not make directly for New
York, Max,” his wife had said to him when the anchor
was weighed, and all preparations were made for their
start, and he had replied that Newport News was nearer,
and that he was going to North Carolina himself for the
early shooting. “From there,” he added, “you and Bessie,
with your mother, can return home by rail, if you
like, or you can remain on the yacht and go where you
please.”</p>

<p>And now they were six hours out from Hamilton; the
sun had dropped out of sight, and the evening was upon
them. Bessie Harlan left the low wicker chair in which
she had been seated and walked forward along the deck.
Suddenly she paused and shaded her eyes with one hand,
while she gazed steadily at some object she had discovered
off the starboard bow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>“Max, come here,” she called, and her brother-in-law
rose lazily from his chair and strolled over beside her.</p>

<p>“Hello!” he said, before she could call his attention to
the object which had attracted her. “You have discovered
a sail, haven’t you?”</p>

<p>“Hardly a sail,” she replied. “What a strange-looking
craft it is.”</p>

<p>Maxwell Kane started. Then he raised his voice and
shouted:</p>

<p>“Forward, there!”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir!”</p>

<p>“What do you make of that craft off the starboard bow,
captain?” he asked of his skipper, who now walked aft
to join them.</p>

<p>“Well, sir,” replied the skipper slowly, “if you had
asked me that question a month ago—which would be
about the time we had to do with a fellow of about that
cut, wasn’t it?—I should have replied that I thought she
was a very good copy of the <i>Shadow</i>, sir.”</p>

<p>“The <i>Shadow</i>!” gasped Bessie, turning a startled gaze
upon the skipper, and then removing it to Max. “Do you
mean the pirate? Do you mean Captain Sparkle?”</p>

<p>Kane laughed aloud, although a close observer might
have detected a note of uneasiness in his merriment.</p>

<p>“Captain Sparkle is in Sing Sing, Bess,” he said.</p>

<p>“He was in Sing Sing when we left New York for Bermuda,”
she replied.</p>

<p>“That craft there certainly does look like the <i>Shadow</i>,”
muttered the skipper. “She’s bearing down upon us, too,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
and coming with the swiftness of the thing she’s named
after.”</p>

<p>“Sparkle couldn’t have escaped,” said Max uneasily;
“and if he had done so, he could not very well have repossessed
himself of the <i>Shadow</i>, could he?”</p>

<p>“I can’t rightly answer that question, Mr. Kane,” replied
the skipper. “You see, sir, I don’t know any more
about it than you do, seeing that I’ve been with you all
the time, and that we left New York so soon after the
capture of the pirate and his wonderful vessel, I don’t
even know what was done with the <i>Shadow</i>. She was
libeled, wasn’t she?”</p>

<p>“Blessed if I know,” replied Kane. “There was a
whole lot of red tape about the disposition of her, and I
didn’t remain around to find out how it did turn out. The
Westchester County authorities claimed her; the New
York police claimed her, and the United States district
attorney claimed her. The last I knew of her, she was
in charge of an inspector of the treasury department, and
nobody seemed to know what would be done with her
eventually.”</p>

<p>Bessie Harlan had remained very quiet during this discussion,
but now she interrupted:</p>

<p>“You have forgotten one thing, Max,” she said.</p>

<p>“Well, what?”</p>

<p>“You have forgotten the count.”</p>

<p>“Oh, blast the count!” was the somewhat savage rejoinder.</p>

<p>“All the same,” continued Bessie, “the count escaped,
did he not?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>“Escaped! I should say he did. Not a sign of him
was seen after Nick Carter, with his assistant Chick and
myself, captured Sparkle and the <i>Shadow</i>.”</p>

<p>“Then you may depend upon it,” she said, “that the
Count of Cadillac has managed somehow to repossess
himself of the <i>Shadow</i>. It was his craft as much as his
brother’s, was it not?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so.”</p>

<p>“And, as a matter of fact, you never did know which
of the brothers was the real count, and which was the
genuine Captain Sparkle, did you?”</p>

<p>“No; I’m in doubt if they knew themselves apart, let
alone the possibility of a third person being wise about it.”</p>

<p>The eyes of all three were still fixed upon the approaching
vessel, which was now not more than half a mile
away.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think we had better run for it?” asked
Bessie now.</p>

<p>Kane laughed.</p>

<p>“Why, Bess,” he said, “if that craft is the <i>Shadow</i>, we
would have about as much chance of running away from
her as a snail would have in a foot-race with a rabbit.</p>

<p>“And it is the <i>Shadow</i>, too. I recognize her now, all
right.”</p>

<p>“What shall you do, Max?” asked Bessie anxiously.</p>

<p>“Do? Nothing. What is there to do?”</p>

<p>“Are you going to let that pirate board you, and do as
he pleases with you, without offering the slightest resistance?”</p>

<p>“Eh? Look here, Bess. In the first place, we do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
know that he is a pirate, and the chances are about a
thousand to one that he is not. The last we knew about
the vessel—that is, the last I knew about her, was that
she was captured, that her captain and crew were all
sent to prison, and that she was herself as much a prisoner
as any of her former crew.”</p>

<p>“And yet we see her now, directly in front of us, and
bearing down upon us as if she meant business. Max,
haven’t you got any revolvers or guns aboard?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes; there are two or three, I imagine.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got one,” said the skipper. “The mate has another.”</p>

<p>“And, Max, you have got two. Wait; I will get
them.”</p>

<p>She was gone in an instant, and presently she reappeared
with a revolver in either hand. One of these she
gave to her brother-in-law, retaining the other one herself.</p>

<p>The skipper, who had gone to possess himself of his
own weapon, and also to call the mate to his side, reappeared
at the same instant; and Kane’s wife and her
mother, having discovered that something out of the ordinary
was happening, left their seats under the awning
and added themselves to the group.</p>

<p>In the meantime the <i>Shadow</i> had drawn much nearer,
and she had now changed her course so that she would
lie directly across the bow of the <i>Goalong</i>, a maneuver
which Kane remembered as one which was a favorite
with her commander. And now, too, the sharp crack
of a rifled gun came to their ears from the deck of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
stranger, and a vaporlike smoke, which ascended from
amidships, told them as plainly as words could have
done that it proceeded from the turret, where they knew
there had formerly been a machine gun located.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Mrs. Kane of her husband; but
it was the skipper who replied.</p>

<p>“It’s the pirate, ma’am,” he said. “It’s the <i>Shadow</i>.
Perhaps you’ll remember her, for this isn’t the first time
we’ve been afoul of her. And that there gun from her
amidships turret is an order for us to slow down and lay
to. Now, Mr. Kane, what shall I do? Shall I obey it,
or shall I go right along as if nothing had happened?”</p>

<p>Kane had entirely recovered his composure. He was
thoroughly master of himself, now that he knew an emergency
was at hand.</p>

<p>He turned coolly, and faced his skipper.</p>

<p>“You will keep going ahead at full speed, just as long
as the wheel will turn,” he said. “And, Mr. Manning,
I wish you would call down to the engine and fire rooms
and give orders to crowd her to the limit. If that fellow
gets aboard of me he will have to do it on the fly, I can
tell you that.”</p>

<p>“It’s more than likely that his next cartridge won’t be
a blank,” said Manning.</p>

<p>“I don’t care if it is loaded with dynamite; I won’t
stop now till I’m obliged to,” was Kane’s reply.</p>

<p>Then he turned to his wife, who was standing beside
him.</p>

<p>“Cora,” he said, “you and Bessie and your mother
will have to go below. More than likely there will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
bullets coming aboard of us before we are many minutes
older, and I don’t want you people here to get hit.”</p>

<p>“Cora and mama can do as they like,” said Bessie
Harlan, replying as if Kane had addressed his remark
to her, “but you don’t catch me going below, Maxwell
Kane.</p>

<p>“I’d much rather be up here where I can see things
than to go down there and never know a thing about
what is happening.”</p>

<p>“But, Bess, you’ll be—— There! Look there!”</p>

<p>A half-dozen sharp reports, one following another with
great rapidity, came from the deck of the <i>Shadow</i> at that
instant, and at least three of the half-pound shot fired
from the machine gun knocked splinters out of the woodwork
forward, and one of them went through the wheel-house
and clipped off one of the spokes as deftly as if it
had been a ninepin.</p>

<p>“That looks like business, Mr. Kane,” said Manning
coolly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Max. “That chap means business.
There is no doubt of that. Hello! What is he going
to do now? Sheer off, do you think?”</p>

<p>“No; he’s up to some new deviltry. Forward, there,
at the wheel!” called the skipper.</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir.”</p>

<p>“Lay her off two more points to port.”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir; off she goes.”</p>

<p>“The pirate is coming about, now, Mr. Kane,” said
the skipper, then. “I think I can tell you what her game
is now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, what is it?”</p>

<p>“Why, sir, that pirate fellow means to run up alongside
of us. The <i>Shadow</i> is enough faster than we are
for him to do that with ease, and with this smooth sea
it will be like running a baby-farm. When he has done
that, he’ll either make fast to us and board us, or he’ll
riddle us with those half-pound shot at his leisure, sir.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE ABDUCTION OF BESSIE HARLAN.</span></h2>

<p>From the deck of the <i>Goalong</i>, Bessie Harlan watched
the maneuvering of the pirate craft with an intensity
which amounted almost to fascination.</p>

<p>It had not occurred to her thus far to feel personal
fear. She remembered another occasion when she had
met the pirate, and she recalled that she had been treated
with the utmost consideration at that time, and now it
did not occur to her that the rover of the sea would visit
personal harm upon any of them.</p>

<p>She supposed that he intended merely to rob, and she
did not know that, once having fired a gun from his
deck, and thereby actually menacing another vessel on the
high seas, he was just as amenable to capital punishment
for his crime as if he had murdered the entire crew of
the <i>Goalong</i> in cold blood.</p>

<p>Her ideas concerning his really harmless intention, so
far as physical violence was concerned, seemed to be supported
by the fact that after those six shots, some of
which had found their way aboard Kane’s yacht, he did
not again resort to his gun.</p>

<p>It was plain, however, that he had discovered that
Kane did not mean to stop until he was compelled to
do so; and that the rover had figured out a way to force
him to stop his engines became more and more apparent
as the moments passed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a pretty sight, too, which Bessie Harlan and
the others were watching. The long, low, narrow hull
of the <i>Shadow</i>, funnelless, and with no deck housings
of any kind save the sunbonnet-shaped turret forward,
and the larger one amidships, from which the gun had
been fired; and with the two masts, devoid of spars and
sails, shining like silver and pointing like fingers into the
air, had more the appearance of a living monster of the
deep, to her eyes, than the look of a modern vessel.</p>

<p>The <i>Shadow</i> had been approaching the <i>Goalong</i> from
a direction which was a few points off the starboard bow,
but now she had altered her course so that it somewhat
resembled the shape of an inverted interrogation point,
and which, if pursued, would eventually swing her
around so that she would come up in a parallel course
with the yacht, and on the starboard side of her.</p>

<p>She would be running in the same direction, also, and
as she was much fleeter than the <i>Goalong</i>, she would then
have no difficulty in maintaining her position alongside
and performing one of the acts which the skipper, Manning,
had suggested—that is, either her men would board
the yacht or they would pour in upon her the contents
of that deadly machine gun.</p>

<p>And now, as the <i>Shadow</i> came about, a rod shot up
from the interior of one of the steel masts, and from it
there presently floated out to the breeze a blood-red flag;
and at the same moment, from the amidships turret, a figure
came out on the convex, turtle-back deck and stood
there with folded arms, facing the yacht.</p>

<p>There was no mark of any kind upon the red field of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
the flag, and it was not more red than the costume of
the pirate himself, who seemed to have taken the pattern
of his costume from the tragedy of “Hamlet.”</p>

<p>A mask of the same color as his costume covered his
face, and his left hand rested upon the gold-mounted hilt
of a rapier at his side. And he stood there, calmly watching
the yacht, which, although it was struggling through
the water at its utmost speed, might as well have stopped
its engines and waited, for the <i>Shadow</i> was overhauling
her as swiftly and as surely as a greyhound would have
overtaken a terrier.</p>

<p>Closer and closer the pirate craft approached, until not
more than a hundred feet separated the two vessels; and
then her engines slowed down until the two were running
along side by side, and so near together that conversation
might easily be carried on from one deck to the
other. It was then that Maxwell Kane slowly and deliberately
raised the revolver he held in his hand, and
was taking careful aim at the pirate chief, when the quiet
voice of Bessie Harlan murmured in his ear:</p>

<p>“Don’t shoot, Max. Wait.” she said.</p>

<p>But instead of desisting, Kane pulled the trigger.</p>

<p>The explosion followed and the bullet was sped on its
way; but if those on the deck of the yacht had expected
to see the pirate pitch forward to his own deck, shot
through the heart, they were disappointed. He did not
move from the position he had occupied ever since he
made his appearance, save that he removed his plumed
hat mockingly from his head and made a sweeping gesture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
with it toward the man who had fired. And then
he called out to him.</p>

<p>“Don’t do that again,” he commanded coolly, “unless
you wish me to riddle you with bullets, regardless of
those who are standing beside you. Put down your
weapon, Mr. Kane, and command all others there to do
the same. Then order your engines stopped. If you do
not, I will disable you.”</p>

<p>“You had better obey him,” said the skipper, in a low
tone. “He means what he says. This is no child’s play,
Mr. Kane.”</p>

<p>“I am beginning to realize that fact,” replied Kane.</p>

<p>“Shall I give the order to stop her, sir?”</p>

<p>“Yes; there is no use in risking the lives of everybody
aboard. The fellow is a pirate, all right.”</p>

<p>“And he is also the Count of Cadillac,” murmured
Bessie. “I remember his voice.”</p>

<p>“I have had no doubt of that from the first moment
we discovered the <i>Shadow</i>,” replied Kane, with a grimace.</p>

<p>The bell in the engine-room rang at that moment, and
the engines of the <i>Goalong</i> were slowed down. Then
another bell, and they stopped altogether; and, although
there was no sound of a bell from the pirate craft, she
kept pace with the yacht in coming to a stop, so that
after a moment they were forging ahead, side by side,
with only their natural momentum to give them steerage
way.</p>

<p>And after a moment this was also lost, and the two
vessels were rolling almost side by side on the gentle
rise and fall of the dead swell of the ocean. Then, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
if by prearrangement, rather than as the result of an
order just given, half a score of men suddenly appeared
on the deck of the rover, beside their chief.</p>

<p>Either they knew exactly what they were expected to
do, or their orders were already given them, for they
took their places along the rail of the <i>Shadow</i> with the
precision of automatons and waited.</p>

<p>A group of them went forward, another group aft,
and a third remained almost amidships, near their chief.
In the possession of each group there were two stout
lines with grappling-irons attached to them, and Kane
and his party, on the deck of the yacht, could see that
the men stood ready to heave them when the proper moment
should arrive.</p>

<p>It was then that Kane’s skipper, Manning, shook his
head doubtfully.</p>

<p>“The <i>Shadow</i> is a much heavier craft than we are, Mr.
Kane,” he said. “If they make fast to us with this dead
swell a-running under us, and heaving our bows into the
air with every rise, she’ll swamp us in no time; but——”</p>

<p>He paused in his pessimistic prognostication, for at
that moment the grappling-irons were thrown aboard.
They caught, too, as if they had been cast by well-practised
hands, and then, as the men of the <i>Shadow</i> made
fast their own ends of the lines, power was given her
and she forged ahead until, with the lines drawn taut, the
two vessels were brought as safely side by side as if the
act had been performed on the bosom of a mill-pond.</p>

<p>And from that moment, too, the wheel of the <i>Shadow</i>
was kept moving, so that the yacht to which she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
made fast was towed slowly through the water, and in
that way the bows of the two vessels were kept headed
toward the swell with sufficient steerageway to keep
them so.</p>

<p>“That pirate feller is a sailor, all right,” muttered Manning.
“I couldn’t have done any better myself.”</p>

<p>In the meantime, the slack of the lines had been taken
up, and now they were lashed firmly into place, so that
the <i>Shadow</i> and the <i>Goalong</i> were held together exactly
as if they had been one vessel. All this time the pirate
chief had retained his position near the turret, with his
arms folded across his breast; but now he took a few
steps aft, until he was directly abreast of the group on
the deck of the yacht, and then he swept them another
bow.</p>

<p>“Ladies,” he said, ignoring Kane, “I have been lying
on and off in the harbor of Hamilton for something more
than a week in order, ultimately, to enjoy the pleasure of
this moment. I regret that I cannot be assured that it
is mutual.”</p>

<p>“What the devil do you want, and what have you
stopped us for on the high seas?” demanded Kane angrily.</p>

<p>The rover turned his eyes, which shone like sparks of
fire through the holes in the mask which concealed his
face toward Kane. Then he made a gesture which his
men evidently understood, for in an instant more Kane
discovered that three wicked-looking rifles were aimed at
his breast, and that behind each one of them was a
masked figure in red.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mr. Kane,” said the pirate coolly, “you are not expected
to speak at all, unless it is in reply to a question
addressed to you. My men have orders to fire and to
kill you if you do not obey. I trust you will have sense
enough to remain uninjured, since silence on your part is
all that is necessary in order to do so.”</p>

<p>Kane ground his teeth together in a rage; but he knew
that the pirate had uttered no idle threat, and that it was
useless to do other than to obey him.</p>

<p>“And shall I be shot, also, if I speak?” demanded
Bessie boldly.</p>

<p>“You, Miss Harlan? I shoot you? Let me assure you
that you are as safe from harm at this moment as if you
were in the boudoir of your own home, surrounded by
all your faithful attendants.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” said Bessie. “That may be true, but it
doesn’t appear so. Are you not Count Cadillac?”</p>

<p>The pirate shrugged his shoulders, and they thought
he laughed a little.</p>

<p>“Just now,” he replied, “I call myself the modern Red
Rover—but I do that merely for the want of a better
title. Captain Sparkle, who formerly commanded this
vessel, is, unfortunately for him, detained elsewhere, and
I have assumed his place. Perhaps it is not too much
for me to admit that I was only known to you as Count
Cadillac. Does that fact reassure you, Miss Harlan?”</p>

<p>“On the contrary, it fills me with dread.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! Why so?”</p>

<p>“Because I cannot understand how a man who possesses
so many of the prerogatives of a gentleman as you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
do, can descend to such a vulgar calling as you have
adopted.”</p>

<p>The pirate shrugged his shoulders again.</p>

<p>“It may be,” he said slowly, “that I will be able to
make that plain to you—later.”</p>

<p>Bessie tossed her head, and was on the point of turning
away, when the voice of the pirate arrested her.</p>

<p>“Wait!” he said sternly. “Remain where you are,
Miss Harlan.”</p>

<p>She wheeled and faced him, with flaming cheeks and
blazing eyes.</p>

<p>“Do you dare!” she began, and paused.</p>

<p>The pirate had made another gesture, which his men
seemed to understand, and in obedience to it several of
them stepped aboard the yacht, while the others drew up
in line along the rail of the <i>Shadow</i> and leveled their rifles
at the entire party, which included, as may now be readily
understood, the crew of the yacht, as well as her owner
and guests.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Harlan,” said the pirate coldly, then, addressing
the mother of the two young women, “you will oblige
me if you will go to your cabin. Not a man of my crew
shall touch you if you obey, but if you refuse you will be
taken there. Thank you. That is the better way.”</p>

<p>He turned then a little, and added:</p>

<p>“Now, Mrs. Kane, I will ask you to follow your
mother. You, Mr. Kane, will follow the two ladies. No
resistance, if you please, and no questions. Mr. Manning,
follow your master.”</p>

<p>The pirate chief watched the four persons until they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
disappeared inside the cabin, and then with a bound he
leaped aboard the yacht and paused within three paces
of where Bessie Harlan stood. She was turning away
to follow in the footsteps of her mother and sister when
the pirate suddenly appeared in front of her, barring
her way.</p>

<p>“Your way lies yonder, Miss Harlan,” he said quietly,
pointing with one hand toward the deck of his own vessel.</p>

<p>Bessie started back in terror, and then she would have
darted past him, and so sought to escape; but, with a
quick bound, he was beside her, and in another instant
she was lifted from her feet and carried, bodily, aboard
the <i>Shadow</i>.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.<br />
<span class="smaller">NICK CARTER IS THE MAN.</span></h2>

<p>“If you scream or call the others to your assistance,”
she heard the pirate say into her ear, as he leaped from
one vessel to the other with her in his arms, “you will
only succeed in having them shot, so be silent.”</p>

<p>So she did not scream. Even in that instant of horror,
when she felt that the pirate was stealing her away for
some terrible fate, she knew not what, she possessed the
courage to remain silent, and so, as she believed, to save
her sister and the others who were with her from instant
death.</p>

<p>A hoarse murmur went up from the crew of the yacht
when they witnessed this high-handed proceeding on the
part of the pirate, for they loved Bessie Harlan. But
they were powerless to help her then; and besides, the
rifles of the pirate crew were aimed at their hearts.
There was nothing that they could do save to stand
quietly by and witness the abduction of Bessie Harlan.</p>

<p>Again the men of the <i>Shadow</i> worked as if every act
of their master’s had been foreseen before they boarded
the yacht.</p>

<p>As they left the deck of the <i>Goalong</i> they also cast
loose the grapplings, and even as the last one stepped
upon the deck of the pirate cruiser, the chief, with Bessie
in his arms, disappeared through the turret into the
hold of the vessel, and as if that were a signal to the engineer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
the <i>Shadow</i> at the same instant shot ahead like a
thing of life, starting away at almost full speed. And
so swiftly did she move that, in the gathering gloom—and
it was now almost dark—she soon disappeared entirely
from view.</p>

<p>For a moment after her departure the crew of the
<i>Goalong</i> to a man remained where they were standing,
as if the unheard-of proceeding of which they had just
been witnesses had paralyzed their energies.</p>

<p>Then in a body they rushed aft toward the cabin.</p>

<p>But the practised ear and the trained intelligence of the
skipper had already told him that the pirate vessel had
taken her departure, and he was on the point of coming
out on the deck, followed by Kane and his companions,
when the crew called to him. At first the reality of the
horror that had actually occurred did not impress itself
upon any of them. Not one of them realized the truth
of what was told to them—that is, that Bessie had actually
been taken away.</p>

<p>But when Mrs. Harlan, the mother, did realize that
her younger daughter was gone indeed, and was now at
the mercy of the pirate chief, she promptly fainted.</p>

<p>Kane, himself, turned white and cold. In all his conjectures
concerning the pirate—and he had had many
while he was a prisoner below in his own cabin—he had
never once thought of this.</p>

<p>True, he had wondered for a moment that Bessie was
not sent to the cabin with them, but he really did not
give the matter any particular thought; he had certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
not dreamed of such an answer to the question as the one
he now received.</p>

<p>His wife did not faint. She reeled against the bulkhead,
white and haggard, and with her face all pinched
into lines of terror, which rendered her almost unrecognizable;
and for a time she could only moan her sorrow.</p>

<p>“Poor Bessie!” she murmured. “Poor Bessie! Rather
had we all been murdered in cold blood by that pirate
fiend than that this should have happened.”</p>

<p>Presently she started, for a hand had fallen on her
shoulder. The maids had come on deck and taken charge
of her mother, and in her agony she had utterly forgotten
her husband.</p>

<p>“You, Max?” she asked, without turning.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“It is awful!” she murmured, with a shudder. “What
shall we do, dear?”</p>

<p>“Bessie had my revolver in her hand,” said Max, irrelevantly.</p>

<p>“God grant that she will have the courage to use it!”
moaned her sister.</p>

<p>“She will, Cora, against him or—herself, if it comes
to that.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Kane shivered. Then she flung her arms around
her husband’s neck and sobbed as if her heart would
indeed break; but after awhile she became quieter, and
presently she repeated her former question.</p>

<p>“What shall we do, Max?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” he replied vaguely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>“There is Nick Carter,” she sobbed. “You know how
quickly he accomplished something before.”</p>

<p>“Yes; of course, I shall go to him at once. That goes
without saying, Cora. But how will even Carter be able
to pursue and catch this brute of a pirate? We have no
trace of him. He leaves no track behind him on the
pathless ocean. Even now he is far out of sight, and
we have no idea in which direction he has gone. And
besides, Cora, if we do the very best we can we cannot
hope to arrive in New York in less than forty-eight
hours from now. Two whole days, that is; and probably
that damned vil—pardon me, dear—probably that infernal
scoundrel is going faster than we are, in the opposite
direction. You see, don’t you, Cora, that if we knew
exactly where to find the pirate we could not hope to
overtake him in much less than two weeks, could we?”</p>

<p>“Do you mean, Max, that we cannot—cannot hope
to—to save Bessie?” sobbed his wife.</p>

<p>“I mean this, Cora—and we might as well look the
matter squarely in the face, now that it has confronted
us, don’t you think so?”</p>

<p>“Well? Go on, Max.”</p>

<p>“What I was going to say was this: Bessie has got
a lot of sand and pluck. You know that.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, if anybody saves Bess it will be Bess herself
who accomplishes it, and it wouldn’t surprise me a bit
if she should find a way to do it. There is one thing
dead sure, and that is that we can’t do anything—not a
blessed thing—now. We’ve got to wait till we can get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
the right sort of a start. We can’t hope to overtake
Bess, and be on hand to do her any sort of good, inside
of two or three weeks, and it may be as many months.
The Atlantic Ocean is a whopping big place, and there
are several other oceans to take into account, too; and
so, here is the face of the thing, as I wanted you to look
at it a moment ago: If Bessie is not in immediate danger,
she is just about as safe three months from now as
she would be three days from now. If that pirate means
any devil’s work, he’ll get about it before he is very
much older; and if it happens that there is enough of the
gentleman left in him to make him keep his hands off
and respect her, why, then no actual harm will come to
her. Don’t you see that?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and it makes me hope. Because I do think——”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“I think that perhaps the count is still a gentleman,
outwardly, at least; don’t you?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t. But I do think he is in love with Bess.
And if he is, that is the only one thing in the world that
will save her.”</p>

<p>“Why, Max, that very fact—if it is a fact——”</p>

<p>“There, there, now! That very fact is what I’m talking
about. If he is really in love with Bess, she’ll be
as safe from harm when we find her as if she had been
aboard the <i>Goalong</i> all the time.”</p>

<p>“But, Max! Have you thought——”</p>

<p>“Thought what?”</p>

<p>“Of the name of it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, confound the name of it. It’s the game, and not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
the name, with which we are concerned just now. Bess
has got a gun; don’t forget that—and she knows how to
use it, too. And Cadillac is in love with her, up to his
ears, if I am any judge of human nature. When he
was our guest it was as plain as the nose on your face.”</p>

<p>“Yes; I thought so, too.”</p>

<p>“Well, as I said a minute ago, Bess knows how to use
a gun all right, but if there is one thing which she knows
how to make use of better than any other, it is a man
who is in love with her. She can twist one of ’em around
her fingers like straws, and I’ll bet a million that she’ll
be doing the act for the modern red rover, as he calls
himself, before he’s had her a prisoner an hour. She’ll
be boss of the whole shooting match before she has been
a day aboard the <i>Shadow</i>.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps she is dead, even now, while we are talking
about her,” said Cora, shuddering.</p>

<p>“She is either in no immediate danger, or somebody
is dead; you can bet on that, girl!”</p>

<p>“If only she did not faint away,” murmured Kane’s
wife; and he looked at her strangely for a moment and
then shrugged his shoulders as he replied:</p>

<p>“Bess isn’t one of the fainting kind, Cora. And now,
don’t you think you had better go to your mother?”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear, but what shall I tell her?”</p>

<p>“Tell her! There isn’t anything to tell her, is there?
Tell her what we have been talking about. Tell her
every idea that has occurred to us about the matter. Tell
her that we are legging it back for New York and Nick
Carter just as fast as this blessed old tub will carry us.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
Tell her that when we get there I’ll pull down stars out
of the sky and dig up mountains with my two hands to
save Bess. Tell her—she already knows it, but you can
remind her of it, just the same—tell her that your chump
husband is worth a number of millions of dollars, and
that he’ll spend every last dollar he’s got to find Bess and
save her, and to hunt down the fellow that stole her, no
matter what has happened; and tell her if she can think
of anything else that she would like done, it shall be done
if there are men in the world to do it. And tell her not
to cry. Crying won’t help the matter any, and it interferes
with good, clear eyesight. I’d like to swear, but
swearing doesn’t assist the judgment any, as I have discovered,
so you see I don’t do it. Brace up, Cora, girl!
Bite on the bullet. It hurts, I know. It hurts me just
as much as it does you. But let me tell you this much
before we part—and it means a good deal, too.”</p>

<p>“What, Max?”</p>

<p>“Nick Carter thinks a lot of Bessie, if anybody should
ask you. He won’t require any seven-league boots behind
him to spur him on in this matter; and if there is a
man on top of earth who can figure this thing out about
the way it really is, that man is Nick Carter. He will
see through it like a glass, and blow me if I don’t somehow
feel as if he would know at once just about where
to look for Bessie and the pirate.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE PIRATE’S BEAUTIFUL CAPTIVE.</span></h2>

<p>And now we must return for a space to the pirate
cruiser, the <i>Shadow</i>. Although Bessie Harlan did not
faint when the pirate chief seized her and bore her aboard
of his own craft, from the deck of the yacht, she was
in reality so near to doing so that she was rendered as
helpless as a babe in the arms of the man who carried
her.</p>

<p>She was conscious only that she was borne from the
deck of one vessel to the other, and that then her abductor
carried her down a short flight of steps into the interior
of the boat. She heard him open a door, and she was
conscious then that she was in a lighted room, although
she could not have opened her eyes to save her life, it
seemed to her.</p>

<p>They traversed this room, or cabin—she did not see
what it was—and presently passed through a second door.
Inside this second apartment the air was cool and sweet.
She could hear the bur-r-r of an electric fan and could
feel the draft it created.</p>

<p>But still she did not open her eyes. Then she realized
that her captor was putting her down, and he did it so
quietly and so tenderly that she decided he must believe
that she had fainted, and, in order not to undeceive him,
she kept her eyes closed.</p>

<p>Her only thought now was to escape from his arms—to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
liberate herself from his immediate grasp—to get away
from him, from his touch; to be out of his reach.</p>

<p>For she still held Max Kane’s revolver in her grasp,
and she closed her fingers even more tightly around the
butt of it, in order that it might not drop out of her
reach, and she pushed it even farther among the folds
of her dress in order that he might not by any possibility
discover that she had it.</p>

<p>And then he put her down. She felt that she was resting
upon an upholstered chair, and that the pirate was
bending over her, studying her features.</p>

<p>She permitted herself to breathe a little—just enough
to reassure him so that he would not resort to extreme
measures to bring her back to consciousness. She only
hoped that he would go away and leave her until she
could have time to recover her senses fully—until she
might think over the awful thing that had happened, and
decide what to do.</p>

<p>She even thought calmly about the expedient of putting
a bullet through her own heart the moment the pirate
should leave her alone, and she regarded the idea quite
calmly, as something which was not at all impracticable.
He touched her hands with the tips of his own fingers,
having drawn off his gauntleted gloves in order to do so.
Then he touched her brow in the same manner, and she
shuddered almost, lest he should use his lips.</p>

<p>But, if he thought of it, he did not attempt to do it.</p>

<p>She heard him sigh. Then she knew that he had
straightened up and drawn away from her. It seemed
to her that he stood there a long time, watching her,
before he made a move to go away; but at last he did so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>Her sense of hearing was so acute that she could almost
hear him as he breathed. She knew when he began
to move away from her, and she could feel the increasing
distance between them, as he went nearer to the door by
which they had entered.</p>

<p>Then she heard the clicking of the latch, and she permitted
the lids of her eyes to rise ever so little—just
enough so that she could see through her drooping lashes
the figure of the pirate chieftain standing on the
threshold.</p>

<p>The mask still covered his face; evidently he had forgotten
it. He was looking back upon her with an expression
she could not fathom, for the reason that she
could not see through the mask; but his attitude was
kindly, if one can see kindness in the mere figure of a
person.</p>

<p>Then he went out and closed the door softly behind
him. For one, two, three, four, five seconds of time Bessie
did not move. She counted them in order that she
might make no mistake; and she waited that length of
time lest the man might repent of his hasty departure
and decide to return.</p>

<p>Then, at the end of the five seconds, she raised the
revolver from under the folds of her dress and leveled
it at the closed door.</p>

<p>She maintained that position while she counted ten
more, and if the rover had opened the door during that
time she would have shot him. She did not know that,
when arrayed in the costume he was then wearing, he
wore a steel breastplate under his shirt which would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
turned her bullet just as it turned Kane’s, earlier in the
evening.</p>

<p>But now fifteen seconds had elapsed since the pirate
left her. A full quarter of a minute, and she leaped to
her feet and darted toward the door. There was no ordinary
lock upon it, but there was a chain-bolt, and this
she at once slipped into place.</p>

<p>That done, she breathed a sigh of relief; and then, with
an added shiver, she looked hastily around to discover if
there were other means of entrance to the palatial cabin
in which she was now a prisoner.</p>

<p>Farther aft there were portières over a doorway, and
she hurried to it, but only to discover that it was the
means of communication with a passage from which four
staterooms opened.</p>

<p>There was no other way out of the cabin save through
the door used by the pirate; Bessie convinced herself of
that at once, and with untold relief. Then she peered
into the staterooms, one after another, and she discovered
with alarm that one of them was all too plainly the
abode of the corsair.</p>

<p>And then, when she would have made further investigation,
she heard the rattle of the chain on the door she
had fastened, and she tiptoed her way across the cabin
until she stood almost against it, listening. The pirate
had returned. She knew he was there, although, from
the position she occupied almost behind the door, she
could not see him. After a moment, during which she
knew that he turned and gave a low-toned order to some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
person who was standing near him, he called her by
name.</p>

<p>“Miss Harlan!” he said. “Miss Harlan!”</p>

<p>She did not reply. He repeated the summons, somewhat
louder than before, but she made no answer.</p>

<p>“Won’t you open the door?” he requested. “At least
let me know that you hear me, or I will be obliged to
break it down in order to assure myself that you are uninjured.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I hear you,” she said, then, realizing how simple
a matter it would be for him to burst the door open.</p>

<p>“Will you not open the door?” he asked her again.</p>

<p>“No,” she replied.</p>

<p>“If I assure you that you will be as free from harm
as if you were aboard your brother’s yacht?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“But I wish to talk with you, and this is not a pleasant
attitude for conversation.”</p>

<p>She made no reply to this.</p>

<p>“Will you open the door?” he asked again.</p>

<p>“No,” she said. “I will not open the door.”</p>

<p>It was stretched, of course, to the utmost limit of the
chain, which permitted an aperture of two or three inches.</p>

<p>She still stood behind it, out of his sight, and with
the revolver tightly grasped in her right hand; but now,
fearing that he might decide to break the door from its
fastenings, she drew back one step more, farther into the
corner. Then she saw something, she did not know what,
pass through the opening between the door and the casing
and touch against the chain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>That something was a pair of steel nippers, although
she did not know it; and she was dismayed the next moment
to see the chain fall loosely away from the catch,
and to see that the door was swinging open. With one
bound she reached the table in the center of the cabin,
and with another she passed around it so that it was between
her and the door. Then she raised the revolver
and pointed it at the pirate.</p>

<p>He came through the doorway and closed it behind
him, and then he stood there with his back against it,
smiling upon her almost as if he were amused.</p>

<p>“If you make an effort to approach me or to touch
me,” she said, and her voice was clear and strong, belying
the awful terror that was wringing her heart, “if you
come as much as two steps nearer to me than you are
now, I will shoot you!”</p>

<p>For a moment he permitted his eyes to dwell upon her
face, quizzically, without deigning a reply; it seemed to
her that he was weighing what she had said to him, as,
indeed, he was doing, though not in the manner she
thought.</p>

<p>After a moment he shrugged his shoulders a little and
laughed softly.</p>

<p>“Very well,” he said, “shoot me. I assure you that I
should not greatly care if you did so.”</p>

<p>She made no reply, and presently he added:</p>

<p>“However, for your own sake, I should advise you not
to do so. You see, Miss Harlan, it would greatly add
to your present danger if I were to die. I do not express
that with exact correctness, for, as a matter of fact, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
are now in no danger at all, while if I were to die you
might be in considerable.”</p>

<p>“I will not pretend to understand you,” she said scornfully.</p>

<p>“No? Suppose I make myself more explicit?”</p>

<p>“As you please,” she retorted.</p>

<p>“Must I remain here until I do so?”</p>

<p>“I have already told you that if you attempt to come
nearer I will kill you. I did not deceive you when I said
that.”</p>

<p>Again he shrugged his shoulders, and the ghost of a
smile played around his handsome features, for, as the
reader has guessed, he no longer wore the mask, nor the
hat, nor the wig which went with it. Otherwise he was
still in the costume of the corsair.</p>

<p>“Very good,” he said. “Perhaps you will be more
lenient when I have explained.”</p>

<p>“If you can explain,” she replied coldly.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I can explain, Miss Harlan. There are always
explanations for things, you know.”</p>

<p>Her reply was a haughty stare. She did not offer
him so much as a gesture by way of encouragement.</p>

<p>“Has it occurred to you to attempt to explain to yourself
why I dared to bring you to this vessel, and into
this cabin, by force, and utterly against your will?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Shall I tell you?”</p>

<p>“If you will tell me the truth about it—yes.”</p>

<p>“I shall tell you nothing but the truth, Miss Harlan.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>Her lips curled with scorn, but she made no reply.</p>

<p>“Do you recall something that I said to you once, on
the deck of Mr. Kane’s yacht?”</p>

<p>“You have said a great many things to me there, Count
Cadillac, if that be your own name, which I doubt.”
There was a little frightened catch in her voice, which
she strove to conceal by forcing herself to be insolent;
but he heard it, and he knew that he had startled her.</p>

<p>“Miss Harlan,” he said rapidly, “this conversation is
only the beginning of a very great deal that I have to
say to you, and it is my duty to inform you, with all the
emphasis at my command, before I attempt to say another
word, that as long as you honor this vessel with
your presence, with or against your own free will, you
shall be treated in every way as an honored guest upon
it. There will be no word or act said or done in your
presence which can in any way offend your tenderest sensibilities.
May I beg that you will believe me?”</p>

<p>There was so much sincerity in his voice that she believed
him in spite of herself, and for a moment the conviction
that she was free from the nameless horror of
her position, which had already almost driven her mad,
overcame her.</p>

<p>“Then why, why, why did you bring me here at all?”
she cried.</p>

<p>She had forgotten the weapon she held in her hand, in
that instant, and the muzzle drooped until it touched the
table unheeded. It would have been an easy matter for
him then, had he wished to do so, to have stepped forward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
and possessed himself of the weapon before she
could have recovered it; but he did not move.</p>

<p>“Your question brings us back again to the one I just
asked,” he said. “Shall I repeat it?”</p>

<p>If she heard him she did not heed, for she made no
reply.</p>

<p>“Do you remember—don’t you remember that particular
something I said to you at the time I refer to, when
we were together as guests on Mr. Kane’s yacht?”</p>

<p>“You said very many things to me, Count Cadillac. I
do not recall anything——”</p>

<p>“I told you that I loved you, Miss Harlan. I asked
you to be my wife; and you did not entirely refuse me.”</p>

<p>She raised her head now, and her eyes were blazing
with wrath—righteous wrath, so intense that it made her
forget their relative positions.</p>

<p>“You dare to repeat that to me, now, after—after all
that has happened since that time?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“Miss Harlan,” he said calmly, deliberately, but not
unkindly, “I have brought you here by force, if you will,
in order that I might say it—in order that I might continue
saying it, over and over again, day after day. I
am an outlaw now. I know it; but I am still a gentleman.
I——”</p>

<p>“A gentleman, indeed!” she interrupted him. “Thank
God that word has a different meaning in America than
it does where you were born. A gentleman! Say rather
an impostor, a swindler, a bogus count, a thief!”</p>

<p>The man winced as if he had received a blow, and his
face went deadly white, like the waxen face of a corpse.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
For a moment even his lips seemed bloodless, and his
fingers clinched into the palms of his hands until the
manicured nails drew blood where he dug them into his
flesh.</p>

<p>But he made no other motion.</p>

<p>He stood like a statue before her. He seemed scarcely
to breathe; and for more than a full minute he did not
speak.</p>

<p>“I have expected something very like that from you,”
he said, at last, in a voice in which the effort to remain
calm was plainly apparent. “In a measure I have schooled
myself to hear it; but I did not know how hard it would
be—how terrible it would sound from your lips. If I
had known that, I almost doubt if I would have brought
you here at all, Miss Harlan.</p>

<p>“At least I am not an impostor,” he resumed, after another
pause. “I am the Count of Cadillac, whatever else
I may happen to be. My family is among the oldest of
Anjou. My ancestors count back into the Dark Ages almost,
among the oldest, the best, the bravest, and the
most honorable.</p>

<p>“Nor am I a swindler, Miss Harlan. I do not think
you thought that, even when you said it.</p>

<p>“Nor am I a thief. Save your own person, I have
never stolen a thing in my life.</p>

<p>“However, I do not expect you to believe all this, at
least just at present. I did not suppose that you would
do so when I brought you here, but it was in the hope
that time would give me an opportunity to convince you
of its truth, that I decided on this lawless act.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>“Wait; I have not done, nor will I be done, ever, until
you consent to listen to me with at least an outward show
of interest.</p>

<p>“And I prefer to begin with you frankly. That is why
I began this conversation by admitting to you that I have
stolen you from your friends, and brought you here by
force, because I love you; and because I have a hope,
away down in my heart, that I will end by winning your
consent to be my wife.”</p>

<p>Bessie had permitted her revolver to rest with the
muzzle against the table ever since it had dropped there
some time before; but now she raised it. He watched her
silently, wondering if she intended to use it upon him;
and, if the truth be told, caring very little if she did
so. But she held it daintily in her hand; and then, with
her eyes fixed searchingly upon his face, she said slowly:</p>

<p>“Do you see this pistol? Rather than become your
wife, and rather than live to be forced to confess to my
sister and my friends the insults to which you have subjected
me, Count Cadillac, I would a thousand times turn
it upon myself—so!”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE TIME AND THE HOUR!</span></h2>

<p>The pirate chieftain—or, as we will call him for the
present, Count Cadillac—had not the slightest idea of
Bessie’s intention until she had succeeded in turning the
weapon upon herself, and the muzzle of it was already
against her temple.</p>

<p>If the revolver had been an ordinary one, or if the
muscles of Bessie Harlan’s fingers had been firmer and
stronger, she must have taken her own life then and
there, before her companion could have done aught to prevent
it. But the weapon was of the double-action pattern;
more than that, the action was firm and strong, so
that it required a considerable exertion of the muscles of
the fingers to work it.</p>

<p>Then again, the position in which she was obliged to
hold it strained the muscles of the right hand in such
a position that the feat of pulling the trigger sufficiently
to raise the hammer past the catch was twice difficult.
Double-action revolvers are not the best in the world for
the uses of people with suicidal intent.</p>

<p>As has already been said, the muzzle of the weapon
was already against her temple, before the count fully
realized her intent; but then he leaped forward with a
sudden cry. Perhaps his sudden action, together with
the cry he uttered, had something to do with disconcerting
her; at all events, he was in time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>It is doubtful, too, if she realized what she was about
to do.</p>

<p>A creature of impulses always, the count’s words of
love spoken at such a time, and bringing to mind, as they
did, that the time was not far distant in the past when
she had consented to listen to him, and when she had not
repulsed him—when even she had secretly convinced herself
that she might some day love this man—filled her
with such horror of her present position that death
seemed to be the only way of escape.</p>

<p>It is certain that she intended to kill herself. It is certain
that she intended to send the bullet through her
brain and thus to escape at once and for all time the
horror of her present surroundings. It is also certain
that the sudden activity of the count prevented her from
carrying her impulse to a fatal termination.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that the table was between them;
that she stood facing him at one side of it, while he was
half-way across the cabin from her, at the opposite side.
But his leap toward her was like the spring of a panther,
and the cry he uttered was so filled with horror, amazement,
terror, and remorse for bringing her to such a pass,
that it startled even her, wrapped up as she was in her
fatal resolve.</p>

<p>As he leaped forward he threw himself bodily across
the table, scattering the books and papers, and the electric
drop-light that stood in the center of it, in every direction,
and upon every side.</p>

<p>And he managed, somehow, to reach her arm and
hand. He managed, somehow, to seize the wrist of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
hand which held the weapon—to deflect it, and to knock
it from her grasp with such force that it was sent hurling
across the room, where it fell, clattering, against the
mahogany bulkhead. It was not even discharged.</p>

<p>The hammer, which her tender muscles had been unable
to raise, fell again into place without touching the
cartridge in the chamber, and Bessie stood for an instant,
abashed, before him.</p>

<p>The table was still between them. He remained, leaning
upon it with both hands, and with his face thrust
forward toward her, speechless with dismay, alarm, and
with thanksgiving for his power to prevent the consummation
of her terrible act.</p>

<p>And she stood opposite him, a few feet away, white
and staring—herself speechless from the terror of the
thing which had approached her so closely, and yet had
passed her by.</p>

<p>For a moment it was a tableau which neither of them
comprehended; and then the count did the only thing he
could have done under the circumstances, to help her to
regain her composure, and to convince her that she was
not in the terrible danger she dreaded from his presence.</p>

<p>He straightened himself back upon his feet, calmly and
slowly, until he stood upright before her. Then he folded
his arms across his chest, and looked into her eyes silently.
Presently he pointed with one finger toward the
weapon where it was lying against the bulkhead, and he
said slowly:</p>

<p>“Yonder is your weapon, Miss Harlan. Let me suggest
that you resume possession of it, in order that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
may still have the means about you to protect yourself
against a danger which exists only in your imagination.”</p>

<p>She did not move, and after a moment he continued:</p>

<p>“I have assured you that you are safe here—as safe as
any honored guest might be anywhere in the world.
While we are aboard this vessel together, while you are a
passenger upon it, I should like to have free access to
this cabin—in short, I should be glad if you will consider
it a common meeting-place between us. But yonder”—he
pointed toward the portières which divided the cabin
from the passageway—“yonder, beyond those curtains, is
a portion of the <i>Shadow</i> which you may regard as your
personal domain. Beyond that point no human being
save yourself shall penetrate, so long as you are my guest.</p>

<p>“And there,” he continued, “you will find every convenience,
and every article of wearing-apparel, which you
can require. The clothing belonged to Madame Cadillac,
the wife of my brother, as good and true and splendid
a woman as ever drew breath. You know something
about her, for you have heard Nick Carter talk about
her; you have heard the husband of your sister describe
her.</p>

<p>“You are the only woman aboard this vessel, but that
need make no difference. You have but to touch the
button yonder to secure the services of the steward, who
will serve you, at any time, with anything you require,
which he possesses.</p>

<p>“And now, Miss Harlan, I will bid you good night.
Until some time to-morrow, at least, you will not be again
intruded upon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>He turned swiftly and would have disappeared through
the door had she not held up one hand in a gesture to detain
him.</p>

<p>“Wait,” she said simply.</p>

<p>“Yes?” he said, in reply.</p>

<p>“You have convinced me,” she said, “that you intend
me no immediate personal harm.”</p>

<p>He bowed his head, without replying in words.</p>

<p>“And I doubt,” she continued, “if you realize the incalculable
and terrible injury you inflict upon me with
every additional moment I pass aboard this vessel.”</p>

<p>“I have taken that into consideration,” he replied calmly.
“I know how you view it. It is too late now, however,
to remedy it. If it were not too late, I would set
you back aboard the <i>Goalong</i>. As it is——”</p>

<p>“As it is,” she interrupted, “permit me to doubt your
word in that respect, Count Cadillac.”</p>

<p>Again he bowed without replying.</p>

<p>“I wish you to tell me where you are taking me,” she
said.</p>

<p>“To Anjou,” he replied laconically.</p>

<p>“To your château in France?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“For what purpose?”</p>

<p>“To make you my wife, when we arrive there, if in the
meantime I am permitted to win your consent.”</p>

<p>“You are at least frank.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And if you do not succeed in winning my consent—what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
disposition do you intend to make of me in that
case?”</p>

<p>“I intend to return you to your friends.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! Would it not have been better to have left
me with my friends? Do you think it possible to win my
regard under such monstrous circumstances as those with
which you have surrounded me?”</p>

<p>“I think I shall at least succeed in winning your respect.”</p>

<p>“What! Win my respect, when you have stolen from
me all the respect and esteem with which I have ever
been regarded by the friends from whom you have
stolen me?”</p>

<p>“Miss Harlan, you are as safe here as——”</p>

<p>“Stop, sir! You are, perhaps, positive of the truth of
that statement, and I will admit that you have partially
convinced me of it; but are you so ingenuous, so unsophisticated
in regard to worldly matters, as to suppose
for a moment that others will regard my present plight in
that manner? It would have been better, much better for
me, Count Cadillac, had you murdered me in cold blood
before you brought me here as you have done. It would
have been better for you had you permitted me to make
use of that weapon which I just now turned upon myself,
to end my life, and afterward used it for the same purpose
upon yourself; and it would have been much better
for both of us had you met the fate of your brother, who
is now a convict.</p>

<p>“Wait, sir, I have not done. I will finish what I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
to say, and then I will thank you if you will leave me to
myself.</p>

<p>“I shall not take my own life now, Count Cadillac; I
shall live. Back yonder in New York there is a man
toward whom my brother is now speeding, with all the
power the engines of his yacht contain. You know to
whom I refer.”</p>

<p>“Nick Carter!”</p>

<p>“Aye, Nick Carter. Do you remember him, Count
Cadillac? Do you doubt that he will search for me and
find me? Do you doubt that he will also search for you
and find you? And do you doubt, for one moment, what
will happen to you when he does find you?</p>

<p>“Ah! sir, it does not matter now, in your case, how
soon you set me at liberty—you have committed this act
of wrong against me, and Nick Carter will hunt you down
for it as surely as you stand there now. He will find
you, if you are in France, in Anjou, in Patagonia, or at
the north pole. He will find you, and he will hold you
to strict account for your work this night. Be assured
of that much!</p>

<p>“And I have said that I will not again attempt my own
life. I will not. I will live and wait—live and hope for
the coming of that hour when you will find yourself face
to face with him—face to face with Nick Carter. And
now, sir, good night. I have no doubt that you will enjoy
pleasant dreams.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE DETECTIVE SIZES UP THE CASE.</span></h2>

<p>When the <i>Goalong</i> passed the Narrows and was making
her way rapidly through the upper harbor, it was approaching
the evening of the second day after her encounter
with the pirate cruiser, <i>Shadow</i>.</p>

<p>Maxwell Kane was standing near the wheel-house as
they passed inside the bay, and, after glancing at his
watch, he turned and walked aft, where his wife and her
mother were seated, silent, under the awning. Both
were sad and care-worn, for the terrible uncertainty as to
the fate of the beloved sister and daughter had almost
prostrated them. And yet, they had borne up wonderfully
well under the circumstances.</p>

<p>“I am always good at picking winners,” Kane had said
to them on one occasion, “and I will take Bess against the
field any time. That pirate will get left at the pole, you
see if he doesn’t, and he’ll never come within a thousand
yards of our filly. You see!”</p>

<p>Just now, when he walked aft, he had another idea on
his mind.</p>

<p>“Mother,” he said, to the elder woman, “we will be at
the foot of West Twenty-third Street in something more
than an hour; that is to say, in exactly forty-eight hours
since we parted with the <i>Shadow</i>.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Maxwell,” she replied. “Well?”</p>

<p>“I was about to suggest this: An hour more or less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
now won’t cut much ice in this affair we’ve got on hand,
will it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know exactly what you mean, Maxwell; but
go on.”</p>

<p>“I want you and Cora to remain on board when we
land; see?”</p>

<p>“You don’t wish us to go ashore? Really, Maxwell, I
feel as if I must——”</p>

<p>“I don’t want you to go ashore—either of you—until
after we have seen and talked with Nick Carter. Just
the very first moment when I can leave the yacht I will
do so, and I will get him over the telephone and ask him
to come to us; and we won’t any of us say a blessed word
about anything that has happened on this cruise, until
after we have seen and talked with him. Is that agreeable?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, I suppose so.”</p>

<p>“I have given orders to Manning to that effect. And
now, with that understanding, I’ll have myself put ashore
the first moment possible. In the meantime, if anybody
should happen to come out to the yacht, you will not
receive them?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not.”</p>

<p>“It is not at all likely that anybody will do so, you
know; but I wish to have it understood.”</p>

<p>“Very well, Maxwell.”</p>

<p>True to Kane’s prophecy, the <i>Goalong</i> arrived at the
time he said she would, and in a very short time after
that he was in communication with the detective. Their
conversation was short, but very much to the point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>“Is that you, Nick?” Kane asked; and when he had
received an affirmative reply he continued:</p>

<p>“Don’t ask me for particulars over the phone, but come
down here as quickly as you can, will you? It is a matter
of life and death, old man.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be there at once,” was the reply; and Kane heard
the click of the receiver as the detective replaced it at
the other end.</p>

<p>And he had not long to wait after that.</p>

<p>He did not return at once to the yacht, but lingered
where he was until he saw the detective leap from a car
and approach him; then he led the way directly to his
launch, and the two were speedily set aboard the yacht.
In as few words as possible, he then related the story
of their adventure which had ended so disastrously—in
the abduction of Bessie Harlan.</p>

<p>The very first question which Nick then asked was one
which Kane had foreseen. It was:</p>

<p>“Who, besides yourselves, is aware of this affair?”</p>

<p>“Not a soul in the world, save the people aboard this
yacht—and aboard the pirate, of course.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said Nick slowly and emphatically, “not a soul
save yourselves must ever know about it.”</p>

<p>“Just my own idea,” said Kane.</p>

<p>“It is for her sake,” continued Nick Carter. “Ladies,
when you go ashore, you must say not a thing about this
sad occurrence. Give out—if you must make any explanation
at all—that Miss Harlan has remained at Bermuda,
or that you have dropped her somewhere on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
route homeward. For her own sake her present predicament
must never be known.”</p>

<p>“We realize that fully,” said Mrs. Kane.</p>

<p>“Can you keep your crew from talking about the pirate?”
asked Nick, of Max.</p>

<p>“You bet I can.”</p>

<p>“Then see that you do so.”</p>

<p>“But Mr. Carter,” asked the mother, “can you not give
us some hope of her rescue?”</p>

<p>“Hope? Certainly I can. Hope? There is no occasion
for anything else save hope.”</p>

<p>“But think—think of her awful predicament.”</p>

<p>“I have thought of it. I am thinking of it now. Madam,
you have often heard the expression that you cannot
make a silk purse out of a sow’s ear; but has it ever occurred
to you that it is quite as difficult an undertaking
to make a sow’s ear out of a silk purse?”</p>

<p>“I do not understand you. Mr. Carter.”</p>

<p>“Then I will explain. We are agreed, are we not, that
the captain of the <i>Shadow</i> is no other and no less a person
than Count Cadillac?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Very well. If Count Cadillac had been reared a pirate—if
he had passed all his life before he appeared here
in society among us, in the slums of the world, a scoundrel,
a thief, an impostor, and a felon, his advent here
would have been a parallel with making a silk purse out
of a sow’s ear. Now, we all know that while he was
among us, he at least appeared the gentleman, and, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
we are satisfied that his antecedents were and are
good.”</p>

<p>“That is certainly true, Nick,” said Kane. “I begin to
see the point you are getting at.”</p>

<p>“Very well. Now, on the other hand, if he has always
been a gentleman until he took up this calling of a pirate,
he has undertaken the proposition of turning the saying
the other way ’round; eh?”</p>

<p>“Changing himself into a sow’s ear, when he has, heretofore,
been a sort of a silk purse; is that the idea?”</p>

<p>“Exactly.”</p>

<p>“How does it apply, Mr. Carter?”</p>

<p>“Why, his natural proclivities are those of a gentleman.
His calling as a pirate is an avocation rather than
a vocation. He can play the brute, but he cannot wholly
become one.”</p>

<p>“He is certainly acting the part of one now,” said Mrs.
Kane.</p>

<p>“Granted; but it is only outwardly. Inherently, he is
still a man of genteel tendencies. He has held you up
in the middle of the ocean and robbed you of the greatest
treasure you possess, but he has not done it for ransom—he
has done it because he is in love with Bessie, and
because he realized the utter hopelessness of his love,
since we sent his brother to prison, and proved to our
own satisfaction that he was as deep in the mud as his
brother was in the mire.</p>

<p>“Don’t you understand that the moment Bessie became
a prisoner aboard his craft he realized her entire helplessness?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
Don’t you see that he never realized the enormity
of the outrage he was committing, until he saw her seated
there in his cabin, absolutely at his mercy? Can’t I make
you understand that, bad as he is, all the good there is
in him rose to the surface at that moment, and every
chivalric strain there is in him, descended from his ancestors,
appealed to him then and there to protect her?”</p>

<p>“The point is,” said Kane, “that he started in to make
a sow’s ear out of himself, and has had an opportunity to
find out that it can’t be done; eh?”</p>

<p>“Precisely. There are some things which cannot be
accomplished by a man, no matter how intent he may be
upon it; and the greatest of them all is, that he cannot
change his nature. The genteel blood which flows in the
veins of Count Cadillac would no more permit him to
offer offense to Bessie Harlan, unprotected as she is, than
it would you or me, Kane.”</p>

<p>“By Jove, Carter! I believe you!”</p>

<p>“Certainly; so, you see, we must start in with the assurance
that she is as safe from actual harm where she
is as if she were here with us now.”</p>

<p>The mother sighed.</p>

<p>“I wish I could feel it so,” she said.</p>

<p>“It is as true, madam, as that you are seated there.
Her position is, of course, a false one. She is in a terrible
situation. But it is neither fatal nor vital. Have I convinced
you, Mrs. Harlan?”</p>

<p>“You have more than half-done so, sir.”</p>

<p>“Then let us proceed. We must now arrive at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
quickest and best way of rescuing her; and we must agree
that when she is at last rescued—as she will be in short
order—the secret of her adventure must remain with us—with
only those who are concerned in it—forever.”</p>

<p>“By thunder! Carter, you are getting at the meat of
the thing in short order. I knew that you would do it.
I couldn’t think of a method to cheer these women, try
as I might, and here you have accomplished it in a moment.”</p>

<p>“We must now get about the rescue,” said Nick, again.</p>

<p>“But how? How shall we get about it? You can’t
trace that infernal craft of his across the waters of the
ocean!”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Eh? Why not? Can you?”</p>

<p>“Certainly you can; or, at least, certainly we can.”</p>

<p>“For Heaven’s sake, how?”</p>

<p>“Do you recall, Kane, the night when we swam aboard
the <i>Shadow</i>?” asked Nick, referring to the time of the
first capture of the pirate cruiser, when the brother of the
count had been taken prisoner and sent to his just deserts.</p>

<p>“I should say I do.”</p>

<p>“Do you remember the conversation I overheard between
the count’s brother—Captain Sparkle—and his
wife?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Of course.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you recall the fact that at that time we learned
the whole secret of their piratical proclivities? Don’t you
remember how the woman hated it all, and hated her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
husband, also, because he had ever gone into the venture?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And his explanation to her of his reasons, doubtless
given to her for the hundredth or thousandth time?”</p>

<p>“Yes; certainly.”</p>

<p>“Let me recall it to you, nevertheless. Over in his
own country they are descendants of one of the oldest
families of the oldest province of France—Anjou. There
he possesses large estates, a château, and all that the
heart of a Frenchman desires, save the one necessity,
money. He became a pirate in order to possess himself
of that necessary money. He had decided that there were
hundreds of rich men in this country from whom he
could purloin certain large sums which would mean a fortune
to him, but which would not affect them, even after
they had been robbed. His idea was that they were so
rich that they would never miss at all what he took from
them.”</p>

<p>“Yes; I remember all that.”</p>

<p>“His only idea in becoming a pirate was to restore his
fallen fortunes; to redeem his estates; to rebuild his château;
to become a grandee, as his ancestors had been for
many generations before him; to settle down there at last,
in quiet and in happiness, rich, admired, respected, and
esteemed. And he would have accomplished it, too, if
he had not run up against you, Kane.”</p>

<p>“Say, rather, against you, Nick.”</p>

<p>“Oh! well, it is the same thing. We were fortunate
in cutting short his piratical career, and he is now paying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
the penalty for his misdeeds. Now, Kane, I am satisfied
that this brother, the real count, is a better man than the
one we captured. There is more of the gentility of his
family in him. I have never thought that he was entirely
a willing party to the pirate business. He was an
accessory, of course, because he remained quiescent, and
did not betray his brother, but I doubt very much if he
ever willingly committed a piratical act, or stole, until
he first stole the <i>Shadow</i> from her moorings here in the
city, and then held you up in mid-ocean.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“Now, we are endeavoring to trace his course across
the ocean, are we not?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then we have to consider why he has done the things
he has.”</p>

<p>“Sure.”</p>

<p>“First, then, it goes without saying that he was in love
with Bessie, does it not?”</p>

<p>“I think so.”</p>

<p>“You saw it. I saw it. Your wife saw it. We all
saw it. Isn’t it so?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” they all assented.</p>

<p>“Very good. Now, if you will hark back to the capture
of his brother, you will see how all of the real count’s
castles in the air were shattered by that event.”</p>

<p>“I see.”</p>

<p>“The brother was a married man; he could only retrieve
his fortunes in some such manner as he adopted;
but with the count, it was different. He was single. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
had fallen in love with Bessie. If he could succeed in
winning her for his wife, his fortunes would be retrieved
on the spot, and after a manner entirely honorable; for
Bessie is rich, in her own right, is she not?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I think he really loved her. I think that she was attracted
to him. I even think that it might have ended
by her marrying him. It is certain that he thought so.
Then, in an instant, the cup he was holding to his lips
was shattered. His hopes were dashed to the ground.
He determined to disappear. He did so. Then he began
to think out some way of overcoming the difficulty that
had arisen; of bridging the chasm that had suddenly been
dug at his feet. And, Kane, he saw but one way—only
one. There was the yacht where he could possess himself
of it. Bessie was in Bermuda. He could steal the
<i>Shadow</i>. He could hold up the <i>Goalong</i> and take Bessie
away, bodily. Thus, at least, he would find the opportunity
to plead with her—to present his side of the case
exactly as it is; and, perhaps, in spite of all, to win her,
for he believed she loved him. At the worst, he could
not be lower in her opinion than he already was. This
afforded him a chance to win, and he took it.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.<br />
<span class="smaller">PLANNING THE PIRATE’S CAPTURE.</span></h2>

<p>“But all this,” said Kane, “does not track the fellow
across the briny.”</p>

<p>“I am coming to that.”</p>

<p>“You figure that he has taken her—or is taking her—to
Anjou?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“In the first place, Kane, he must have decided, in his
own mind, that this trip of his across the ocean, with
Bessie as a passenger on the <i>Shadow</i>, is his last and only
chance.”</p>

<p>“I should say so.”</p>

<p>“And at the end of that voyage lies his fate.”</p>

<p>“Humph! Well?”</p>

<p>“Before he decided to take the terrible risk of capturing
Bessie and carrying her away as his prisoner, he must
have made up his mind that all outlawry, save that one
act upon which his mind was resolved, must be a thing of
the past.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps so. Who knows?”</p>

<p>“I think I know. I think I am putting myself in the
place of that man. ‘Put yourself in his place’ is a pretty
good maxim, when you wish to get at the real inwardness
of an act committed by another.”</p>

<p>“I believe that. Go on, please.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>“When he got away with the <i>Shadow</i> and resolved to
capture Bessie, he figuratively took the bit in his teeth.”</p>

<p>“I should say he did.”</p>

<p>“But you must not forget that he could not place himself
in a worse position than that in which he already
found himself, so far as his future and his desires were
concerned. In short, old man, he has thought it all over
with great calmness, and, as calmly, he has selected—Bessie,
or death.”</p>

<p>“By Jove, Nick!”</p>

<p>“Without her, life has seemed to him not worth the
living; and without having first had an opportunity to explain
things to her, as they really were, death itself
seemed almost impossible. Don’t you understand, that if
he had gone away somewhere and killed himself quietly,
that all her life Bessie would have thought of him—if
she thought of him at all—as a despicable scoundrel?”</p>

<p>“Well, she would have been pretty nearly right.”</p>

<p>“Granted; but not from his standpoint.”</p>

<p>“Well, then——”</p>

<p>“The other side of the picture which he saw was this:
He could capture her; he could take her, a captive, aboard
the <i>Shadow</i>; he could keep her there, a passenger, a
guest, and an unwilling—or, perhaps, a willing—listener
to his plea. In either case, she would have heard it. In
either case, he would have had an opportunity to explain.
In either case, she would be compelled to listen to him,
and in either case, she would in the end think not so ill
of him as she had thought. He believed that he could
prove to her, while she was aboard the pirate cruiser, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
he was not all bad; he believed that he could convince her
that it was because of true love for her that he had dared
to do that thing; he believed that there might be enough
romance in her nature to induce her to listen to him
under such circumstances, where she would never have
done so else; he believed that there was a possibility that
she might really love him, and that love would triumph
over all obstacles.</p>

<p>“But—and here is the crucial point—he believed that if
he failed, that if she refused utterly to listen to him, that
is she scorned him, she would at least be led to believe in
the purity of his motives, and to think of him after his
death as one not so utterly bad as she had pictured him.”</p>

<p>“After his death?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes; for if my idea is at all correct, he means
to kill himself at the end of the voyage, if he finds that
he cannot win her forgiveness and her love. He is a
Frenchman, remember; he is romantic; he has staked his
entire fortune, and his life, as well, upon this throw, and
if he loses, he will shrug his shoulders and put a bullet
through his brains as calmly as he stood upon the deck
of the <i>Shadow</i> and told you that if you resisted him, he
would shoot.”</p>

<p>“And so, you think——”</p>

<p>“I think—nay, I almost know, that he will take Bessie
directly to Anjou—to that château of his. I think he will
treat her as an honored guest. I believe that she will
suffer no inconvenience, and, least of all do I regard her
as in personal danger. And at the end of the cruise of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
the <i>Shadow</i>, I believe that if she so wills it, he will open
wide the way for her to go free.”</p>

<p>Kane was silent for a long time, as were the others;
but at last the millionaire raised his head again and spoke.</p>

<p>“Nick,” he said, “there is always a chance that you
may be wrong, isn’t there?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then let us look at both sides of this question.”</p>

<p>“Very well.”</p>

<p>“Suppose that you are all in the wrong?”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“Suppose that your conjectures as to Count Cadillac’s
ultimate purpose are wrong, and that he has no more idea
of taking her to Anjou than you have? We won’t depart
from the original theme, that you believe he will treat
her square—for I agree with you about that silk-purse-and-sow’s-ear
business—but suppose that his intention is
merely to keep her a prisoner where she is, on board the
<i>Shadow</i>, until such time as she will agree to become his
wife; eh?”</p>

<p>“Go ahead, Kane. You have not finished yet.”</p>

<p>“No; I haven’t. Suppose all that; eh? He can live
by following up his piratical profession, and the devil
himself can’t catch him. If he is pursued too hotly, he
can go under water and stay there until the pursuit has
drawn off.”</p>

<p>“Granted. What more?”</p>

<p>“Well, there isn’t any more—at least, there isn’t much
more. But suppose all that, now, where would you look
for him, in such a case?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>“That is quite a different question, Max.”</p>

<p>“I know it is; but we have got to answer it. You see,
Nick, it goes without saying that we start for Anjou at
once. If he is going there with her, he will arrive there
before we could possibly do so ourselves, for the <i>Shadow</i>
is one of the swiftest things I ever saw in the water.”</p>

<p>“She is that.”</p>

<p>“Well, if he is going there, he will be there already
when we arrive. If he is not going there, where will
he be?”</p>

<p>“Somewhere at the opposite side of the world, most
likely.”</p>

<p>“But where?”</p>

<p>“My dear fellow, I cannot answer that any more than
you can.”</p>

<p>“Well, that is what we have got to consider—and just
as sure as you are sitting there, I don’t believe we will
find him at his château. No man, I don’t care a rap how
much of a silk purse he happens to be, is going to give
up life, and hope, and everything else, without continuing
the struggle as long as there is a possibility of coming
out winner.”</p>

<p>“That is quite true.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, the question comes down to this: If
Cadillac does not take Bessie to his château, where shall
we look for them? But wait; you need not reply to that
now, for you have not had time to think about it, and
you are no more capable of answering it than I am, at
the present moment. I will change the question. How
shall we look for them?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>“I had thought,” replied Nick slowly, “of taking passage
on one of the fast ocean liners for the other side, and
hastening direct to Anjou; but your last suggestion puts
a different face upon it. There is another and a better
way.”</p>

<p>“Now, we are getting at it. What is the other and the
better way? Remember, I don’t care a picayune what it
costs, even if it goes up into the millions.”</p>

<p>“I know that; but I don’t think it will approach the
millions.”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“This: You and I will take the midnight train to
Washington. In the morning, early, we will call upon
the President. We will explain the situation to him, and
unless I am greatly mistaken, he will find a way to place
the <i>Dolphin</i> at our disposal at once. She is at the Washington
navy-yard now. I happen to know that. He will
also direct the department of state to cable all over the
world to have the <i>Shadow</i> intercepted, wherever she may
appear.”</p>

<p>“Now you’re talking.”</p>

<p>“In that way we will arrive at Anjou quicker than we
could if we traveled by a regular ocean liner, and so had
to make part of the journey overland after we arrived in
France. We can go directly to his château, doubtless.
It will not be hard to find.”</p>

<p>“And say, Nick.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“It may be that he will have set Bess at liberty before
we get there. We may find that she has gone to Paris<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
or London, and is there awaiting us, after cabling the
fact that she is safe and well.”</p>

<p>“It is possible.”</p>

<p>“Well, I was going to say this: If that should turn out
to be the case, what, then?”</p>

<p>“What, then?” replied Nick. “Why, then you may
return to New York with Bessie, if you like, but you can
leave me behind, for I’ve got an engagement to keep
with Count Cadillac; and, Max, I’m going to keep it, if
I have to search over the whole world to find him in
order to do it. I’ve got several questions to ask him, and
he’s got a few answers to give. He has taken one step
too far in this business for Nick Carter ever to let up
on him.”</p>

<p>“Bully for you, Nick! But, I say! Suppose—eh?—suppose
we should find that Bessie has forgiven him, and
married him?”</p>

<p>For a moment the detective did not reply; but then,
very quietly, he said:</p>

<p>“I think, Max, that we won’t try to cross any bridges
until we get to them.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.<br />
<span class="smaller">A WEIRD VOICE OF THE NIGHT.</span></h2>

<p>It is not necessary to give in detail here the record of
Nick Carter’s trip, accompanied as he was by Maxwell
Kane, to Washington; and of his interview with the
President very little need be said, save that the detective’s
prophecy was fully fulfilled.</p>

<p>The <i>Dolphin</i> was placed at their disposal at once, and
there was no time lost in sailing. Moreover, the state
and navy departments were set in motion, and information
concerning the pirate was despatched all over the
world, so there could be little doubt that he could exist
for a long time on the high seas without being captured.</p>

<p>The Château Cadillac was readily found when the detective
and his friend arrived in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>It was an extremely old building, founded, no doubt,
in the Middle Ages. It bore evidence that time after
time it had sunk into ruins, only to be again reclaimed.
No doubt it had been stormed and torn almost from its
foundations early in its history; but now it looked merely
what it was—a historic old pile of graystone, moss-grown
and ivy-wreathed, with a huge, square tower at
one end of it, which clung to the edge of an abrupt precipice
jutting out over the sea, so that it seemed as if it
must topple and fall into the rock-bound and turbulent
waters.</p>

<p>But it had stood there through many ages, defiant of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
storm and time alike; and it stood there now, as the two
men approached it, grim, uninviting, repellant, gloomy,
almost terrible.</p>

<p>Nor was the approach to it more inviting than its
appearance. It was situated at the apex of a neck of
land which jutted out into the sea, and thus formed a
treacherous-looking harbor on one side of it, while the
endless water tossed and fumed, and threw spray hundreds
of feet into the air on the other.</p>

<p>From the foundation of the old castle to the water
below was a fall of a sheer hundred feet, and if you add
to this ninety feet more, which was approximately the
height of the tower itself, you will get some idea of its
appearance.</p>

<p>Small, oblong windows appeared at intervals along the
height of the tower. Their position was irregular, almost
as if they were there merely to give light upon winding
stairs, which ascended inside. Back of the tower was a
huge building, irregular in shape, and representing several
periods in the history of the country. Behind all
this, the land stretched away, narrowing as it extended
inland, until part of it which adjoined the mainland was
little more than a causeway.</p>

<p>The <i>Dolphin</i> had approached from the sea, early that
morning, and the detective, from her deck, had taken a
thorough view of the harbor and all the surrounding territory.</p>

<p>No sign whatever of the <i>Shadow</i> had been discovered,
and after standing on and off awhile, the <i>Dolphin</i>
had sailed away again, and disappeared from view from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
the château, if, indeed, she had been seen from there
at all.</p>

<p>But, nevertheless, the <i>Dolphin</i> had not gone far.</p>

<p>Three miles away a place had been discovered where
the detective and his friend could be put ashore, and they
had left the despatch-boat—really a vessel of war under
that name—and embarked for the balance of their adventure
on foot.</p>

<p>But the <i>Dolphin</i> was not to desert them. She was to
stand on and off until she was signaled from the shore;
and there was a code of signals arranged between her
commander and the detective which made it possible for
them to communicate in the night, as well as during
the day.</p>

<p>As the two approached the causeway together, it was
impossible to tell whether the castle was deserted or not.
There certainly was no outward sign of life about the
building, and already each of them had decided in his own
mind that their search here would probably be fruitless.</p>

<p>However, the <i>Dolphin</i> had paused long enough before
she arrived off the Château Cadillac for Nick to go
ashore and communicate with the American ambassador
in Paris, and by that means he had discovered that nothing
whatever had been heard of Miss Harlan, or of her
daring abductor, or, indeed, of the vessel in which she
had been stolen away.</p>

<p>“I am afraid we are on the wrong scent, Nick,” said
Kane, as they crossed the causeway together.</p>

<p>“Wrong or right, we will know one thing or the other
for a certainty before we search elsewhere,” replied the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
detective. “I cannot disabuse my mind of the idea that
he would bring Bessie here. Cadillac was no fool. He
would know that the navies of the world would be after
him since his exploit in capturing her. He would realize
that you would report the matter at Washington, and that
the cables would be kept hot about him. He could not
hope to escape with the <i>Shadow</i>. Pirates cannot rove
the seas now as they used to do, old man.”</p>

<p>“I know that.”</p>

<p>“Then you can bank upon it that he has brought Bessie
here. You can make up your mind that the <i>Shadow</i> is
somewhere at the bottom of that little harbor, waiting
until Cadillac has further need of her. Remember that he
can sink her at will. Remember that those steel masts
of hers are nothing more or less than means by which she
can be approached and her pumps set to work to raise
her after she has been immersed and abandoned for a
long time. I do not know, but I have no doubt that he
could leave her there for the better part of a year and
then raise her again at will.”</p>

<p>“And what shall we do now, Nick?”</p>

<p>“Do? Why go to the castle.”</p>

<p>“But how are we to get inside?”</p>

<p>“I do not know that—yet.”</p>

<p>“The thing doesn’t look as if we could ever get inside
of it, if those who are already there should choose to
keep us out.”</p>

<p>“Max, I never saw a house in my life which I could
not find a way to enter, if I started out to do it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>“Great Scott! You don’t call that thing a house, do
you?”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s a house, all right, so far as my remark goes.
I’ll find a way to get inside.”</p>

<p>“There is one thing in our favor.”</p>

<p>“What is that?”</p>

<p>“If there happens to be anybody there, on the watch,
they won’t be apt to see our approach. These rocks along
here shelter us, you know.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t be too sure of that. Better keep out of
sight as much as possible.”</p>

<p>The time was late in the afternoon. It was now approaching
dark, in fact. The day had been a cloudy one,
and now a drizzling rain was falling. Taken all in all,
the time for their descent upon the castle could not have
been a more propitious one.</p>

<p>The two strode on silently, side by side, for some distance,
when Kane spoke again.</p>

<p>“Are you going to tackle the front door and demand
admittance?” he asked, while he paused a moment for
breath.</p>

<p>“Not on your life!” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Eh? What are you going to do?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to get inside the place secretly, if possible.”</p>

<p>“But——”</p>

<p>“Look here, Max. We have got to work on the principle
that Bessie is a prisoner inside that old pile of stones,
haven’t we?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Very well. We will start out on the proposition that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
that is a fact. Now, if Cadillac is there, he probably considers
himself more or less safe, for a time at least. He
does not suppose that we would have tracked him here
quite so suddenly. You see, he will have argued that we
have considered him as having returned to the pirate
business for good, and will, therefore, search the seas,
and, perhaps, a few islands in the seas, for him.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“In the meantime he has come here with the <i>Shadow</i>.
He has sunk her under water somewhere inside that
harbor, where, by the way, she will be a good deal safer
than she would on top of it, for it looks like a treacherous
spot to me.”</p>

<p>“And what then?”</p>

<p>“Why, then he has taken his captive ashore. He has
had her conducted to the castle. He has fastened her
away in some great room, probably in the tower, given her
servants to wait upon her, and, in fact, done everything
on earth for her comfort, save the one thing of giving
her back her liberty.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” said Kane. “I’m not half so sure of that
as I pretended to be when we were discussing it in the
presence of my wife and her mother.”</p>

<p>“Never mind. That is my idea, just the same. And,
anyhow, if she is there, and if he is there, you can rest
assured that if we went to the door of the place and demanded
admittance, it would doubtless be granted us, but,
all the same, we would see no sign of the people we are
looking for, and we would be told that the count is in
America.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>“And all the time the count would be nicely hidden
somewhere in the old building. Is that what you mean?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“So you propose to make the search without anybody
being put wise to the fact that you are doing it, eh?”</p>

<p>“Exactly. You see, I have started on the proposition
that the count will consider himself safe here, at least
for a time; on the proposition that he has not yet begun
to keep very strict watch along this causeway we have
just crossed.”</p>

<p>“But he has probably watched the sea, Nick,” interrupted
Kane.</p>

<p>“I presume so.”</p>

<p>“Then he saw the <i>Dolphin</i> this morning.”</p>

<p>“Well, suppose he did so? There is nothing strange
in seeing a vessel approach the coast and sail away again,
is there? She showed no flag; and you don’t suppose he
would know the <i>Dolphin</i> by sight, do you?”</p>

<p>“He is a sailor, and a good one. He would know that
she was American.”</p>

<p>“He might at that. But, even so, he would still be
watching the sea for her return, and not paying much
attention to the land approach. There, Kane; let us stop
here. It will be dark now in a quarter of an hour, and
then we can approach without any danger of being discovered.”</p>

<p>“Can you find your way, Nick, among all these rocks
and pools, and along this slippery cliff, in the dark?”</p>

<p>“Indeed I can. I have taken all my bearings, Max.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
And now, there is nothing to prevent us from enjoying a
smoke while we wait.”</p>

<p>They found a shelter under a shelving rock, where they
were protected from the storm, and there they seated
themselves, lighted their cigars, and disposed themselves
to such comfort as they could find while they awaited the
time to advance.</p>

<p>“Under ordinary circumstances, Max,” said the detective,
“I should prefer to undertake this business to-night
alone. I don’t suppose you care to be left outside,
do you?”</p>

<p>“Not in a thousand years, Nick! No, no! I’m in this
thing to a finish. And, besides, it is more than likely that
you will run into some sort of a scrap inside that old
rookery. If you should, you will need help, and I want
to be on hand.”</p>

<p>“All right. Now, see if you can refrain from talking
for about five minutes, while I do a little thinking. After
that it will be time for us to start on.”</p>

<p>“Midnight would be about the proper time for burglarious
enterprises, wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p>The detective did not reply, and Kane also lapsed into
silence. So the moments passed, until, at last, suddenly
the detective rose to his feet, stretched himself, yawned,
threw away the stump of his cigar, and said:</p>

<p>“Come on, Max.”</p>

<p>“Going?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I’m right behind you, old chap, and I’ll continue right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
behind you until the end of the chapter, if anybody should
ask you.”</p>

<p>The walls of the castle loomed in front of them as they
advanced, like the outlines of some great, historic beast.
The night was much too dark for them to see anything
distinctly, but their eyes had not been blinded by exposure
to light of any kind, and so, in effect, they were
enabled to see quite clearly as they advanced.</p>

<p>Once the detective paused and seemed for a moment to
hesitate.</p>

<p>“I only wish,” he said presently, “that it were possible
for us to make a circuit of the old pile.”</p>

<p>“Why?” asked Kane.</p>

<p>“There must be a light in one or more of the windows,
somewhere. Say, Max, I think I can get around the
thing if I try. Will you wait here for me if I promise
faithfully to return to this spot after you before I attempt
to enter the building?”</p>

<p>“What are you going to try to do? Go around it,
looking for lights?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then what is the matter with me going one way while
you go the other? We would meet at the other side, you
know.”</p>

<p>“All right. You go that way,” and Nick pointed with
his finger in the direction he wished Kane to take. “Do
you remember,” he added, “the long, low, galleylike
building we noticed from the deck of the <i>Dolphin</i>? The
one which stretches out like a two-story stone bowling-alley,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
from that wing of the castle to the edge of the
cliff?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I hardly think you will be able to get past that. Wait
for me there.”</p>

<p>“Well, if I can’t get past it, you can’t. How are we
going to get together?”</p>

<p>“Leave that to me. Will you wait for me there?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then skip along. If you discover a window with a
light in it, make a mark on your memory so that you can
locate it later.”</p>

<p>“Sure.”</p>

<p>“Keep a sharp eye out for everything that might be
important.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do that; but suppose I run against a man, or a
dog, or anything of that kind; eh?”</p>

<p>“You will have to decide what to do when the emergency
arises. I would much rather you would not kill
anybody, or be obliged, even, to shoot your gun; but all
the same, don’t take any chances. So long. I’ll meet
you where I said.”</p>

<p>The route which the detective selected for himself was,
of course, the one which he regarded as the most dangerous
one.</p>

<p>He had, during the day, both from the deck of the
<i>Dolphin</i> and also from the land, later, studied the outward
appearance of the castle with great care.</p>

<p>From the sea it had seemed to him that it was impossible
to skirt the base of the tower without falling from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
the cliff into the sea; but from the land side, as they
approached the building, before they reached the causeway,
he had decided differently.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he knew that a path around there would
be narrow and dangerous, and he preferred to take the
risk himself rather than have Kane attempt it. As he
made his way forward now, he steadily approached nearer
and nearer to the walls of the huge building—that is, the
main building; that part of it which extended backward
away from the tower and along the neck of land.</p>

<p>The walls rose beside him, grim, silent, forbidding.</p>

<p>He hurried along close to them, and on his left he could
hear the roar of the sea, where it dashed against the rocks
a hundred feet below him. The edge of that precipice,
he knew, was not more than ten feet from him, and the
darkness had now become so intense under the walls of
the castle that he could barely discern the ground on
which he trod.</p>

<p>Suddenly he came to an abrupt stop, face to face with a
second wall, which seemed for a moment to bar his
further progress; but he quickly discovered that it was
merely a buttress of the castle, and he speedily made his
way around it, although in doing so he was compelled
to approach so near to the edge of the cliff that the slightest
misstep would have precipitated him into the abyss
below.</p>

<p>Then on again, however, without accident.</p>

<p>At last, after he had passed two more such buttresses,
and each with more danger of falling than the last, he
arrived at the tower.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>There he paused a moment; and then, as he was on the
point of starting forward again, he was suddenly held
spellbound in his tracks by the sound of a voice which
seemed to be calling to him from among the clouds; and
he was amazed and almost unbelieving when he recognized
in the words that were uttered his own name.</p>

<p>“Nick Carter! Nick Carter!”</p>

<p>Twice he heard it, and then all was silent again, save
for the pounding of the waves against the rocks below.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE MEN INSIDE THE CASTLE.</span></h2>

<p>There was something so weird and so unreal in the
sound of his own name, coming to the detective as it did,
seemingly from the infinity above him, that for a moment
he quite refused to believe that his ears had not deceived
him.</p>

<p>Remember, there was the thundering of the waves
against the rocks all around him; the boom of the surf
as it broke beneath its own weight and violence farther
out toward the sea; the sobbing and moaning of the wind
over the bleak cliff and through the ruins of the older
part of the castle, and the faint cries of sea-birds coming
to him from far away to windward. All this tended to
render him uncertain about the voice which seemed to
call to him from the black sky over his head; just as all
this made it impossible to determine whether the voice,
if it were indeed a voice, had proceeded from a man or
a woman.</p>

<p>But sober second thought reassured him.</p>

<p>Who, but one person in all the world, could have called
to him there?</p>

<p>He knew that it was impossible, even if Bessie Harlan
were indeed a prisoner inside the old château, that she
should have witnessed his approach, or that she should
have recognized him from her aerie window, even if she
had discovered the approach of two pedestrians before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
the gathering darkness had hidden them from view. But
he explained the seemingly inexplicable phenomenon in
quite another way than that.</p>

<p>“If Bessie is a prisoner there,” he reasoned to himself,
“she believes absolutely that Max and I will come to her
rescue, sooner or later. If she is a prisoner there, she
is confined in a room which overlooks the sea—a room in
this very tower, in fact; and if all that be true, that call
of hers was simply a wail of impatient waiting and longing,
called out by her to the heavens, the clouds, the sea,
the wide, wide world. Not in the hope that it would
literally be heard, perhaps, but, nevertheless, a call to us
to hasten.”</p>

<p>Several moments he waited, wondering if there would
be a repetition of the call; and then, when one came, he
wondered again if he should reply to it. His better judgment
told him not to do so, and so presently he turned
away to pursue his course around the castle.</p>

<p>But he discovered, presently, that he had been deceived
in his surmises that it would be possible for him to skirt
the tower between it and the water, and, at last, satisfied
that he could not do so, he turned back again over the
course he had come.</p>

<p>He was not long in arriving at the spot where he had
left Kane, but he did not pause there. After hesitating
just one instant in order to get his bearings properly, he
started forward again toward the place where they had
agreed to meet.</p>

<p>When he arrived there, however, Maxwell Kane was
not there, and the detective could discover no trace of him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
in any direction. He waited a few moments, thinking that
something might have detained him, and that he had,
therefore, not yet arrived, although he knew all the time
that nothing of an ordinary nature could have done so.</p>

<p>There were no impediments in the way between the
spot where they had parted and where they agreed to
meet.</p>

<p>Nick had just traversed every inch of it, and he had
met with no obstacle of any kind, nor had he seen a sign
of life or a light anywhere.</p>

<p>For that very reason he figured that doubtless something
had attracted the attention of Kane after his arrival
at the place of meeting, and he had gone to investigate.
But after he had waited fully half an hour, the detective
decided that it was time for him to move.</p>

<p>He had not a doubt now that something had happened
to his companion. He was confident, however, that Kane
could not have fallen, or have met with an accident, without
the intervention of another person.</p>

<p>Presently he scribbled these five words: “Wait here till
I return,” on a leaf torn from his book of memoranda,
and, wrapping it in a handkerchief, he weighted it with a
pebble and left it where the white of the cambric would
attract the attention of Kane, should he regain the spot
before the detective could get back again.</p>

<p>“And now to break my way into that castle,” he mused.
“And I must take extra care, too, for if some prowlers
around this old pile have captured Kane, they will be on
the lookout for me as well.”</p>

<p>The low building, which resembled a bowling-alley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
more than anything else, and which extended from one
wing of the castle to the edge of the bluff on the side
toward the harbor, had evidently been erected originally
to serve as a passageway between the château and the
water when the weather was inclement; and this was the
building which was before him now. But in inspecting
it from a distance the detective had decided that this
would provide a means of entrance. It was almost windowless,
and such as it contained were much too small
and too high from the ground to serve his purposes.</p>

<p>He therefore turned again toward the castle, and hurried
toward a spot where he remembered to have seen a
wealth of ivy growing against the old walls. He had not
forgotten their locality, and he went directly to the spot.</p>

<p>The ivy was old and tough, and had grown firmly in
its place, so that when he placed his hands upon it he
knew that it would sustain him readily. He recalled the
fact that the ivy trailed across several windows, and so
he began at once to make his way up it.</p>

<p>The dampness of the falling rain had rendered the ivy
in such a condition that it gave out no sound as he
climbed, while the dark background against which he
clung afforded no opportunity for prying eyes to discover
him.</p>

<p>He climbed rapidly, for he realized now that haste was
necessary. The strange call to him from the window of
the tower, and the disappearance of Maxwell Kane, had
convinced him that all was not to be as smooth sailing as
he had anticipated.</p>

<p>Soon he arrived at a window, set deeply into the wall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
and casemented for defense in time of attack. But this
window had long been in disuse, and even the glass had
been replaced by heavy planking, to keep out the wind
and weather.</p>

<p>There were two more stories above that one, he remembered,
and he continued on, after a pause of only a moment.
The second window at which he arrived was in the
same condition as the first, so in clambering on, he worked
to the right as well as upward, until he arrived at the top
story of the old building. Here the third window offered
the same impediments as had the others, so he continued
on in a straight line toward the front of the castle.</p>

<p>Suddenly, however, he stopped. Directly in front of
him, not three feet distant, a light had suddenly shot
through the darkness, coming, as he quickly discovered,
from one of the windows.</p>

<p>These were set so far back into the wall that it is
doubtful if the sunlight could ever, even under the most
auspicious conditions, penetrate to the interior of the
room; and it was almost as difficult for a light from the
interior to filter to the outside. Two steps more upon the
vine which held him suspended in mid-air brought him to
the window, so that he could see what was passing inside
the room, and he peered cautiously around the casement.</p>

<p>He was rather surprised, then, to discover that he was
looking into what had once been a part of a suite of
rooms, set aside, doubtless, for royalty, or for especially
honored guests at the castle. The room itself was very
large, and had once been magnificently appointed, but now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
its furnishings were tawdry and soiled, yellowed with age,
and musty from disuse.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, there were many persons within the
room. Nick counted six men there. Four of them were
seated at a table engaged in a game of cards, and the
other two were standing near, observing the game.</p>

<p>They were so engrossed in their occupation that it did
not occur to one of them to look toward the window. But
the detective did not linger there to watch them. Instead,
he lowered himself sufficiently so that he could pass unobserved
beneath the window, and then continued on his
way, taking careful note of the location of the room in the
meantime.</p>

<p>He had noted, too, that he would have to pass two more
windows before he arrived at one which did not open
directly into that room, and so he did not pause again in
his advance until he reached the third. Here, also, as he
raised himself, he discovered that there was a light; but
as he peered into the room through the narrow window
he was assured that, for the moment, at least, it was
unoccupied.</p>

<p>The window, too, was slightly ajar; that is, it was open
perhaps half an inch, doubtless for the sake of ventilation.
He stepped into the embrasure, which was very deep, and
slowly pushed the window open in front of him. A
second and more comprehensive glance rendered him
positive that nobody was in the room, and with another
slightly harder pressure, he opened the casement wide,
and stepped inside, closing it, as he had found it, after
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>The room was quite large—possibly twenty-five feet
square; and it was used as a sleeping-room; but he had
no time to take in further details of the place, for at that
instant he heard steps approaching through a corridor,
and he had barely time to leap behind the door when it
was opened from the outside.</p>

<p>Nick had in that instant prepared himself to leap upon
the person who approached, whoever it was, and conquer
him, preparatory to continuing his investigations through
the castle; but fate kindly stepped in and served him a
good turn at this juncture.</p>

<p>The opening of the door, together with the already open
window, created a draft which the flame of the lamp,
burning on the table, could not withstand. As the door
swung open, the lamp flared, sputtered for an instant, and
then went out, leaving the room in total darkness.</p>

<p>Nick could not even discover the outlines of the person
who had entered the room, but a round, French oath, in a
masculine voice, cursing at the ill luck, left him in no
doubt that it was a man.</p>

<p>The extinguishing of the lamp, however, afforded Nick
an excellent opportunity to act, and as the man stepped
forward toward the table, in order to strike another light,
the detective slipped quietly and quickly past him into the
corridor. The man had left the door ajar when he
stepped forward toward the table, but Nick had the presence
of mind to close it, and to close it with a bang,
exactly as if the draft had caught it and slammed it shut.</p>

<p>Then he waited a moment and listened, to discover if
his deception had been successful; but there was no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
further sound from the interior of the room, and the detective
concluded that the man had relighted his lamp
and disposed himself to reading or some other employment,
with no thought that he had passed so near to the
person of an intruder.</p>

<p>And just at this point Nick made another discovery
which was interesting: there was an inside and outside
door to each of the rooms on that corridor. That is, there
was one for general use—the one which he had already
made use of—and another which opened outward into
the corridor, doubtless for use in emergencies.</p>

<p>This door was much heavier than the outside one.
They were relics of old days when the castle was likely
to be stormed, and the occupants might be compelled to
fight from room to room, holding one after another until
they were finally driven from all.</p>

<p>Whatever the original uses were, the present one was
manifest. The detective lost no time in closing that outside
door, and he was agreeably surprised to discover that
it was provided with a huge key, which he had no difficulty
in removing and replacing on the outside. In another
instant he had locked it.</p>

<p>That done, he passed along the corridor toward the
doors of the room wherein he had seen the six men; and
he had no difficulty in locating it, for he had counted
carefully from the outside.</p>

<p>And these doors—there were two of them, he closed
and locked in the same manner as he had served the
others, so that presently he was satisfied that whatever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
adventures he might encounter inside the old château
these seven men whom he had seen would take no part
in them.</p>

<p>“And now for the tower,” he said, aloud, as he turned
away.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII.<br />
<span class="smaller">A COMBAT WITH THE RAPIERS.</span></h2>

<p>But it was fated that Nick Carter was not to proceed
at once to the tower of the castle.</p>

<p>The distance from where he turned again toward the
front of the building, to that part of it which might properly
be called the tower, was some hundreds of feet, and
he had gone not more than half the distance when, just
as he was passing a door, it was opened suddenly and a
man stepped out upon the corridor, confronting him.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to determine which of the two was
the more greatly surprised by the encounter, but it was
certainly the detective who recovered from it first.</p>

<p>The man who confronted him paused in amazement.
Then, when he perceived Nick was a stranger, he opened
his mouth to cry out something. But on that instant Nick
leaped forward. As he did so, the man started backward,
with the cry still unuttered.</p>

<p>His step backward avoided the blow he would have
received, but not all the consequences of it, for the detective,
perceiving in time that his hand would fall short
of reaching the fellow, altered his intention and turned
his onslaught into a rush, so that his two hands fell upon
the man’s chest, and he was thrown backward into the
room where the detective followed him with a bound.</p>

<p>He closed the door almost with the same motion with
which he had passed through it, and then, with his back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
against it, calmly drew his revolver while the man was
rising from the floor, where he had fallen.</p>

<p>“Who the devil are you?” demanded the man, in
French. “<i lang="fr">Sacre, mon ami</i>, but that is an odd way you
have of making your presence known. And why, monsieur,
do you make use of the revolver?”</p>

<p>“Merely to convince you of the wisdom of preserving
silence,” replied Nick, smiling grimly.</p>

<p>“Silence?” The Frenchman chuckled audibly. “My
dear sir, one might yell his lungs loose here, and not be
heard inside an adjoining room. These walls were made
to withstand sieges. And, besides, if I may venture to
inquire, wherefore should I offer to cry out? Eh?”</p>

<p>The Frenchman had stepped back, and Nick saw that
he was evidently a character; and he realized, moreover,
that the man had not the least idea that he himself was
an intruder in the castle. Then, as if to confirm him in
that opinion, the man added:</p>

<p>“Ha! I understand. I comprehend monsieur’s tendencies—his
wish. It is to fight; no?”</p>

<p>The detective could not avoid a smile, but he made no
other reply.</p>

<p>“Ha! I have guessed it,” continued the Frenchman,
rubbing his hands together ecstatically. “It is to fight
with me that monsieur comes here at this hour. Monsieur
is a guest of Count Jean. Perhaps monsieur came to the
château on board the yacht with the count. Is it not so?
Yes? And the count has told monsieur about Antoine
Lafetre. No? It is so; no? Yes? And monsieur has
not the belief that Antoine is the greatest fencing-master<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
of the age. Ha! Monsieur has come to witness a proof
of it, perhaps. Believe me, monsieur shall be gratified.
Monsieur shall be convinced. Yes!”</p>

<p>Nick Carter permitted him to run on without interruption,
for the fellow’s prattle told him at once many things
he desired to know, the most important of which was the
fact that Count Jean de Cadillac had in reality arrived at
the château in the <i>Shadow</i> and was now inside the castle.</p>

<p>It told him, also, that here before him was a conceited
Frenchman, by profession a fencing-master, who considered
himself the “greatest that ever was.” A person
who had not an idea beyond the horizon of his own egotism;
but, above all, a person who, if Nick could win his
confidence, would impart all the information he possessed.</p>

<p>And so, without hesitation, he at once assumed the part
for which the French fencing-master cast him. He
shrugged his own shoulders in true French fashion, and
having returned the revolver to the side pocket of his
coat, he raised his eyes, turned out the palms of his hands
and replied:</p>

<p>“Yes. I have heard that you, Monsieur Antoine, have
some idea of fence, but—parbleu!—it is nothing to what
I can do. Monsieur Antoine has not the requisite strength
of the wrist; not the quickness of the eye; not the nimbleness
of the feet upon the floor; not the touch, the curve,
the twist, the reach with the arm; not the——”</p>

<p>“So? Is it so? Does the monsieur believe what he
says to be true? Ha! It is a relish that you have brought
to me, monsieur. I will instruct you in the fence; no?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
Yes! You shall see. Will the monsieur be kind enough
to step this way?”</p>

<p>This room, like the other which Nick had seen, was
large. It was evidently the home of the fencing-master,
for the walls were covered with foils, swords, rapiers,
broadswords, battle-axes, staves, dueling-pistols, masks,
gauntlets, chest-shields, shoulder-pads—in short, everything
was there which belonged to the arts of offense and
defense with the blade.</p>

<p>At one end of the room was a raised section, which
extended, perhaps, an inch above the surface of the floor,
and this was filled with fine, white sand; and it was toward
this spot that the Frenchman conducted the detective.</p>

<p>“Look,” said the fencing-master, pointing toward some
hooks against the wall. “If monsieur will divest himself
of his coat; so. Ah! It is a pleasure, a relish that monsieur
has brought to me. I will produce my most superb
foils——”</p>

<p>“Foils!” exclaimed Nick, with some outward show of
contempt. “Rapiers, if you please. The foils are for
children.”</p>

<p>“Ha! It is magnificent! It is glorious! But we
fence, then, not for death? No? For the little touch of
the master; is it not so? Yes? For the little twinge at
the lobe of the ear; for the prick like a pin-point at the
nipple of the breast. Ha! Grand! Magnificent! Monsieur
has the true idea. Foils are for children. The fence
shall not be seriously to wound the opponent, then? No?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
No! It shall be to draw the spot of blood, like the glow
of a ruby, one, two, three times? Yes! Three times in
succession. Ha! If you do that, you shall be the victor.
<i lang="fr">En garde, monsieur!</i>”</p>

<p>While the Frenchman was talking he was also preparing
himself for the combat, and every nerve in his
lithe body seemed to be alive with joy at the prospect.
Egotism is the first requisite for a fencing-master.</p>

<p>Nick Carter excelled in the art of fence, as he did in
all other exercises of self-defense. In his youth his father
had neglected none of these requirements in preparing
the son for his career, and he was as perfect in the use of
the foil, the rapier, the broadsword, the staves, and all
weapons of the kind as he was with rifle or revolver.
Then, add to the perfection of science the wonderful
strength which reposed in his muscles, and any fencer will
tell you that nothing on earth should be able to defeat him.</p>

<p>And so the two faced each other, smiling; Nick calm,
confident, reposeful; the Frenchman alert, eager, and
thrilling with pleasure. It is no child’s play to fence with
needle-pointed rapiers without delivering or receiving a
serious wound, and only the most expert of fencers would
dare to undertake it.</p>

<p>Like all fencers, when they begin a combat, these two
felt of one another’s strength of wrist, celerity of action,
keenness of guard and thrust, and foot movement; and
after a few parries the Frenchman leaped back out of
reach for a moment, while he lowered the point of his
weapon and exclaimed:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>“La, la! But it is magnificent. Grande! Glorious!
Monsieur is a foeman worthy to meet the best. He has
the strength of wrist—ah! And the foot movement—yes!
But I will show him that he has met one who is greater
than he. <i lang="fr">En garde, monsieur!</i>”</p>

<p>Both had done the “feeling,” and they now went at the
combat seriously; and Nick, feeling that the time was,
perhaps, short, if he was to accomplish all he wished to
do that night, determined to win out as soon as possible.</p>

<p>He therefore attacked the Frenchman like a cyclone.
He seemed to cover himself with steel; his weapon glinted
like a thousand gems through the air, darting in and out
like flashes of lightning, forming a perfect shield around
his head and breast, and, at the same time, dancing
through the guard of his opponent with every thrust he
made. And yet, for a long time he got no nearer to the
master than that. The Frenchman was really superb in
the practise of his art. He was a master of it; but he was
not a master of the man who stood in front of him like a
granite pillar, suddenly infused with the animation of a
spirit and the strength of a Hercules.</p>

<p>After a few moments of this furious attack, Nick saw
that his opponent was giving ground. He realized that
the pace was telling upon him, and that his own superior
strength was overpowering his adversary.</p>

<p>The Frenchman was rapidly tiring. Once he leaped
back to avoid a thrust, and would have called for a rest
had not Nick laughingly guyed him by asking calmly if
he were tired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>Lafetre was tired; but he would sooner have died then
and there than to have confessed it, and he returned to
the game with redoubled energy. But although the will
was there, the steam to keep it going was not. His wrist
was tired. The strength of Nick’s arm had strained it
more than he would have believed possible before “monsieur”
entered the room so strangely.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, the detective discovered his opportunity.
He stepped forward quickly, almost inside the
Frenchman’s guard; and then——</p>

<p>Thrust, thrust—parry—thrust.</p>

<p>His weapon darted out like the tongue of a toad in
three quick flashes of light. The first of these touched
and half-pierced the Frenchman’s right ear; the second
performed the same service for the left one; the third
pinked him on the breast, so that a little spot of blood, not
larger than a pea, appeared suddenly upon the surface of
the hitherto spotless linen.</p>

<p>And then, before the Frenchman had time to utter a
word, the detective turned his rapier in a circle, caught
the other under the hand-guard and tore it from the fencing-master’s
hand, so that in another instant it fell clattering
at the opposite side of the room.</p>

<p>For a moment Lafetre seemed utterly dazed by what
had happened; and then, with a cry, he leaped forward,
fell upon his knees at Nick’s feet, and, seizing his hands
in his own, kissed them rapturously.</p>

<p>“Magnificent!” he cried. “Never have I seen such
fence! Ah, monsieur, I am your slave henceforth. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
have the wrist of steel, the quickness of lightning, the eye
of omnipotence. It is my first defeat, monsieur, but it
is a victory even to have had the honor to fence with one
so great. Command me. I am your servant. Your
slave, from this hour.”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE SUMMONS AT THE DOOR.</span></h2>

<p>The Frenchman meant what he said, too. There could
be no doubt of that. Sincerity, as well as rapture and
admiration, were depicted on his face as he knelt there
before the detective, kissing his hands.</p>

<p>For a moment Nick regarded him intently, and then he
said:</p>

<p>“Rise, Monsieur Lafetre, for, be assured, you are the
best fencer with whom I have ever contended.”</p>

<p>“Ah! Is it so? Is it true, what you say to me, monsieur?”</p>

<p>“Yes; it is quite true.”</p>

<p>“Then I am content; yes, I am content. It is an honor
but to have fenced with such as you are; but to be told
that I am the greatest with whom you have ever contended—ah!
that is the rapture, indeed. And you, monsieur?
I have not yet the honor of hearing your name.”</p>

<p>“Nor has any other person within the château,” replied
Nick.</p>

<p>“Ha! Say you so? Then you came here by stealth?
Eh? Is it true?”</p>

<p>“Yes; it is quite true.”</p>

<p>“To meet me? To meet Antoine Lafetre? To fence?”</p>

<p>“It seems that I did come here to meet you, and to
fence with you,” replied Nick slowly. “But there was
also another purpose in my coming.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ah, monsieur! I think—perhaps—that I comprehend.”</p>

<p>Lafetre had regained his feet by this time, and both
were rapidly resuming their outer clothing. To this last
remark Nick did not reply. He waited to see what the
Frenchman would have to say next.</p>

<p>“It is the madame; no? The lady who came over the
sea with Monsieur Jean? Yes?”</p>

<p>Nick nodded an affirmative.</p>

<p>“Monsieur is—perhaps—a relative? No? A brother,
a—can it be that monsieur is the husband of madame?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Nick. “I am none of those; but I am her
defender. I have come here to rescue her. To take her
away. To restore her to her friends.”</p>

<p>“And I am gladdened. I am content. It is as it should
be. I, myself—I, Antoine Lafetre, should have constituted
myself her defender as soon as possible. Only to-day—this
afternoon—the madame took me into her confidence.
She told me of the friends who love her, who
are on the other side of the water—in America, where I
should so much like to go.”</p>

<p>“Would you, indeed?” asked Nick. “Then give me a
helping hand in this matter, and you shall return with me.
And I think I can promise you that your art will bring
you in a big revenue over there, from those whom you
will teach to fence.”</p>

<p>“I thank you, monsieur. Perhaps, after I have performed
the service which monsieur asks of me, I shall
have the honor to accept monsieur’s offer. But now—see!”</p>

<p>Lafetre thrust one hand into the pocket of his coat and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
drew forth two letters, which he gave into Nick’s hands;
and to the detective’s surprise he saw that one of them
was addressed to himself, and the other to Maxwell Kane.</p>

<p>The latter he returned into the Frenchman’s hands;
then, holding the other before his eyes, he said:</p>

<p>“This one is for me, monsieur.”</p>

<p>“Ah! Then you are the Nicholas Carter—no?—who
is Mademoiselle Harlan’s affianced. Is it not so? No?
She did not tell me so, but I gathered that much from
what she has told me. Mademoiselle is beautiful, monsieur.”</p>

<p>“Is she well? Is she safe? Has she been injured in
any way? Is she suffering?” asked the detective rapidly.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle is well, though greatly troubled,” replied
Lafetre gravely. “She is also safe, since I, Antoine,
am here to lay down my life in her defense at any
moment. She has not been injured, save in her pride,
and she does not suffer only because of the separation
from her friends.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Lafetre. She indeed found a friend when
she discovered you. Now, where is she at the present
moment?”</p>

<p>“She is in the great tower, monsieur.”</p>

<p>“And can you take me there?”</p>

<p>“Not now, but later? Yes. I was there but now. It
was then that she gave me the letters to send. I told her
that I did not know how soon they might be despatched.
Ah! monsieur, I little thought—I, Antoine—that I should
have the felicity of delivering one of the letters by hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
and so soon, and to the greatest of all fencers in the
world.”</p>

<p>“Is she alone in the tower-room, Antoine?”</p>

<p>“Ah! Monsieur does me even a greater honor. He
admits me to his friendship by making use of one of my
baptismal names in addressing himself to me. No; she
is not alone. Monsieur Jean de Cadillac is with her; but
later? Yes. She will be alone. He will not remain. He
has gone to plead his hopeless cause again.”</p>

<p>“And who besides the count is there with her?”</p>

<p>“There is no one, monsieur.”</p>

<p>“Then, come. We will go there at once. You will
lead the way. I have something to say to him as well.”</p>

<p>“But monsieur is mad to think of such a thing. There
are a hundred armed men in this castle, all ready to do
the bidding of the count at a mere gesture of his hand.
Perhaps the Monsieur Cartier does not know, but they
are smugglers. This is their headquarters. It is to this
place where they bring the spoils of their trade. And it
is I who am also a prisoner here as well as mademoiselle.
I discovered the smugglers’ secrets, unwisely. I have
been detained a prisoner two years. I have the freedom
of the château—yes—but beyond it? La, la! If I should
attempt that, a bullet would stop me. But there is one
among the smugglers—yes—who is my friend. It was
through him whereby I hoped to mail the letters, although
I greatly fear they might not have gone. But monsieur
is mad to think of going to the tower while the count is
there. There are a hundred armed men in the château,
and he has but to signal to them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t care if there are a thousand,” said Nick. “Take
me there.”</p>

<p>“If monsieur insists——”</p>

<p>“I do insist.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr">Eh, bien.</i> It is done. But first, monsieur, my rapier;
and a pistol or two. If it is to fight—and it will be so—it
is well to be prepared.”</p>

<p>Lafetre was as cool now and as determined as the detective
himself. He had no fear; that was evident. He
only needed a leader.</p>

<p>Nick watched him while he coolly provided himself
with such weapons as he needed—the rapier, with which
he had contended against the detective, a pair of revolvers,
and a short sword which he buckled on the side opposite
the rapier.</p>

<p>“It is well to be provided,” he said nonchalantly. “The
rapier is a long weapon with which to fight ruffians, such
as these men are. Sometimes a bludgeon will knock it
from your hand when nothing else would do so; and
then, you see, I have this to fall back upon. No? Come,
monsieur. I am ready.”</p>

<p>He led the way from the room then, closing the door
after him. In the corridor it was dark, but the Frenchman
seemed to know the way perfectly well, and he
started forward without hesitation, although greatly to
Nick’s surprise, in the direction opposite that in which
the tower was located.</p>

<p>Nick stopped him.</p>

<p>“The tower is not in that direction,” he said, whispering
in his ear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, monsieur; but our way to it lies in this direction.
We turn down a corridor to the right, and then again toward
the tower. Then we shall arrive at the place we
want.”</p>

<p>“Good!” said Nick. “Go ahead.”</p>

<p>As they were passing the doors which Nick had fastened
on the outside he called Lafetre’s attention to them,
touching the button of his pocket electric light in order
to do so.</p>

<p>Lafetre nodded and smiled.</p>

<p>“They cannot get out,” he said, “unless they climb
down by way of the vines; and so it was, I have no doubt,
that you entered; no? In this room are the officers of
the two vessels which do the smuggling. In that room
yonder should be the captain of one of them. The other
captain is ill. He is in England, where it is said he will
die. He was wounded by a coast guard.”</p>

<p>“And the men—where are they?” asked Nick.</p>

<p>“They are below, monsieur; two floors. On what you
would call the ground floor. Ah! that magic light of
yours, monsieur. It is fine; but we do not require it
now.”</p>

<p>They went on again, silently and swiftly. They turned
through the corridor to the right as Lafetre had indicated,
and then again toward the tower. Presently they
arrived at the foot of a flight of winding, stone stairs,
which led upward through the darkness, toward the summit
of the tower. Here Nick touched the button of his
light again and glanced at his watch.</p>

<p>“It is nine o’clock, Antoine,” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, monsieur. At ten the count would retire, if we
did not disturb him.”</p>

<p>“And the men? What do they do with themselves?”</p>

<p>“Ah! They smoke, and gamble, and drink themselves
into a stupor. By midnight they would be, for the most
part, helpless.”</p>

<p>“Then why have you not sought such an opportunity to
escape from the château?”</p>

<p>“There are always guards, monsieur. They are always
on the watch. Once, when one of them slept at his post,
Monsieur Jean discovered him, and shot him dead.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” muttered the detective. “There is something
of the sow’s ear about him, after all.”</p>

<p>“What was monsieur pleased to remark?”</p>

<p>“Lead on, Antoine. Let us lose no time.”</p>

<p>They went on in silence after that, winding up the stairs
until it seemed to Nick that they should long ago have
arrived at the summit of the tower. But at last Antoine
paused before a door of solid oak, and, pointing at it, he
said:</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle is there, monsieur. Monsieur Jean is
with her. I think if you knock, he will open: and there
is no other way of gaining admittance, for the door is
solid. But if he will open—ah! Then we will enter before
he has the opportunity to close it again. Is it not so?
No? Yes!”</p>

<p>Nick Carter raised his hand and rapped loudly against
the door.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE DUEL IN THE TOWER.</span></h2>

<p>The detective stood closely against the door when he
rapped upon it, and the moment it started to swing open
in response to the summons he applied his strength
against it so that it was flung inward with a force which
nearly upset Count Jean de Cadillac, who appeared on the
other side. And with the same gesture Nick forced himself
across the threshold, followed instantly, of course,
by Antoine Lafetre, who sought to close it again as
quickly as possible.</p>

<p>But quick as he was, he was not soon enough to prevent
the count from giving the signal of alarm, which Lafetre
well knew would be heard by one or more of the guards,
and which in a short time would bring a horde of men
thundering at the door in their chief’s defense.</p>

<p>In that first pressure against the door when he partly
opened it, Cadillac had recognized the presence of an
enemy; it is doubtful if he did not at that instant also
recognize Nick Carter; and even while he staggered back
from the force of the blow which the weight of the door
delivered against him, he placed a silver whistle to his lips
and blew upon it.</p>

<p>But that was all. The door was closed and locked on
the inside by Antoine, who withdrew the key, and then
stood with his back against it, awaiting orders; and he
was as entirely calm as the detective himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>As Nick stepped into the center of the room and turned
to confront the count, Bessie Harlan sprang, with a glad
cry, from the embrasure of one of the windows, and
almost threw herself into his arms. But she recoiled before
she quite reached him, and shrank backward again
with her hands to her eyes, for Cadillac had drawn a
revolver from his pocket and was in the very act of aiming
it at Nick Carter’s heart.</p>

<p>He was prevented from firing, however, for a gleam of
steel shot through the air, and a light, quick blow descended
upon the count’s wrist, knocking the weapon
from his grasp to the floor, and Antoine said quietly:</p>

<p>“If monsieur le comte attempts to recover his weapon,
I will spit him upon this rapier.”</p>

<p>Nick Carter laughed aloud. Then he turned to Bessie,
who had now recovered somewhat; but she stood staring
at him as if she could hardly believe her senses.</p>

<p>“I knew you would come to my rescue,” she said at
last. “Thank God you are here!”</p>

<p>“Yes; I am here, Miss Harlan; very much here, as
this double-dyed scoundrel shall soon discover,” replied
Nick.</p>

<p>But the count had now also recovered some of his
accustomed coolness. He had retreated to the opposite
side of the room, so that he had placed a table between
himself and the detective; and Nick turned again toward
Bessie.</p>

<p>“Return to the window for a moment while I deal with
this fellow,” said Nick to her; but Antoine stepped forward
hastily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ah! monsieur,” he said, “I have the key of the door
in my possession, so that he cannot get out; and the men
who are coming this way—neither can they enter. Then,
afterward, there is another way out which the count does
not suspect I know about, but which I will show to you.
It is true that it leads through a part of the château, and
that we will doubtless be obliged to fight, but it will not
be like fighting a hundred men on the narrow stairway
we have just ascended. And now, monsieur, I have a
favor to ask of you.”</p>

<p>“A favor, Antoine? What is it?”</p>

<p>“Permit me to fight with the count with the rapiers.
See; I will give him mine—so!” and he tossed his own
gleaming weapon upon the table in front of the count.
“And now, you will let me have the use of yours? Is it
not so? Yes! Ah, it would be child’s play for you to
kill him—you, who have defeated me—Antoine Lafetre—as
if I were a babe. It would not be an equal combat.
Shall it be so? Yes. I thank you.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead, Antoine—if he will fight you. The mademoiselle
and I will act as witnesses.”</p>

<p>Antoine turned, with Nick’s rapier in his grasp, and
approached the table behind which the count still lingered.</p>

<p>“You are a dog,” he said quite calmly. “See! I treat
you so!”</p>

<p>He withdrew a glove from his pocket, and after wadding
it in his hand, threw it deliberately into the count’s
face.</p>

<p>“It shall be fair play, count,” said Nick, “if you have
the courage and the skill to fight with Antoine.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>But he need not have said it. At the blow of the glove,
and because of a little, nervous laugh uttered by Bessie
Harlan, the count seized the rapier from the table in
front of him and leaped from his barricade into the center
of the room.</p>

<p>In an instant the two were at it, and the fighting was
rapid, furious, deadly.</p>

<p>Nick knew that such a pace could not last, and for a
moment he felt a qualm lest Antoine should fall before
the fury of the count’s attack. But he speedily discovered
that there was no need for his misgivings, for the combat
was as fatal as it was swift.</p>

<p>One lunge the count gave which seemed impossible for
Antoine to parry; nor did he do so. But he stepped
quickly backward beyond the reach of the point, and then
lunged forward his own weapon, so that he put the
point of it, to the guard, straight through his adversary’s
breast, piercing his heart.</p>

<p>It was all done so quickly, and it was over so suddenly,
that neither of the spectators had time to realize it; and
the stroke was so deadly that the count sank back upon
the floor with only a sigh. He never uttered another
sound after that.</p>

<p>Bessie, when she saw him fall, ran quickly toward him
and would have knelt beside him had not Nick restrained
her. The man was dead; and he died so suddenly that
he had not even the time to turn his eyes toward the
woman whose every sense of propriety he had outraged,
but whom, withal, he had treated kindly and considerately
to the end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>And then they were brought to themselves again by
Antoine, who was in the act of presenting the borrowed
rapier to Nick.</p>

<p>“Permit me,” he said, bowing. “I did it with that
trick I learned of you, monsieur, but now. And now,
monsieur and mademoiselle, if you will but follow me—no?
Yes! Listen! The smugglers are already on the
stairs. In a moment they will be hammering at the door;
but in an hour they will only just have broken it down.
It is strong. It is reliable. Below, where it is necessary
that we emerge again into the interior of the château, it
is possible that we may meet with opposition; but, monsieur,
we will not anticipate. No. If you will but have
the kindness to come with me now. See!”</p>

<p>He approached the high wainscoting at one side of the
room and pressed against an invisible spring—invisible
to the others, but plain to him—and a section of the wall
opened before them.</p>

<p>“My father was fencing-master to Monsieur Jean’s
father,” he said, simply, in explanation. “I learned the
secret from him. <i lang="fr">Aprez vous, monsieur, et mademoiselle?</i>
No? Then be so good as to follow me. I will lead the
way.”</p>

<p>The stairs which they descended were not unlike the
others by which they had gained the tower-room, save
that they were narrower; and it seemed to Nick that they
wound down and down, interminably. At last, however,
they came to a halt at the foot of them.</p>

<p>“Beyond is the corridor of the ground floor of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
château,” said Antoine, pointing at a door in front of
them.</p>

<p>“Wait a moment,” said Nick, as he was about to open
the door. “Antoine, I have a double duty to perform. I
did not come here alone. I was accompanied by a friend—the
one to whom the other letter is addressed.”</p>

<p>“Max?” asked Bessie.</p>

<p>“Yes. He is here somewhere. He was to meet me at
a point outside the castle, and he did not appear. It is
possible that he has fallen into the hands of the smugglers,
but it is also possible that he is still out there waiting, for
I left a message for him if he should return. But if, on
the other hand, he has been captured, I must first put you
in a place of safety, and then——”</p>

<p>“Will monsieur permit me?” asked Antoine at this
juncture.</p>

<p>“What, Antoine?”</p>

<p>“If monsieur’s friend has been taken prisoner, I know
where he would be confined. Come! We will look there
for him. It is on our way out.”</p>

<p>“Antoine, you’re a treasure! Lead on. Bessie, have
you got that gun yet?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I have never parted with it for a moment, save
once.”</p>

<p>“Good! Go on, Antoine.”</p>

<p>They passed into the corridor. It was silent and deserted,
but not dark, for here and there a light gleamed
dimly through the massive hall.</p>

<p>Along this and down another flight of steps they passed,
and at last stopped before a heavy door, barred with iron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
on the outside; and this bar Antoine lost no time in
removing.</p>

<p>“It is their prison,” he said; and threw the door open,
but only to be thrown from his feet to the floor by the
precipitate attack of Maxwell Kane, who had been waiting
for just such an opportunity.</p>

<p>“Great Scott, Nick!” he exclaimed, when Antoine had
been assisted to his feet and a few necessary explanations
were made; “I didn’t expect to find you here, or I wouldn’t
have come out so swift. I was pounced on from behind
while I was waiting for you, a blanket was chucked over
my head, and I was brought here and locked in before
you could say Jack Robinson. That must have been a
week ago, at least.”</p>

<p>“Two hours and a half,” corrected Nick.</p>

<p>“Is that all?” Then he gathered Bessie under his arm
and led her from the château, following Nick and Antoine.</p>

<p class="tb">There was no more fighting.</p>

<p>Their progress out of the château was not impeded in
any way, nor did they meet with interference across the
causeway.</p>

<p>The place where they had left their conveyance was
reached at midnight, and just as the sun was rising in
the morning they succeeded in signaling the <i>Dolphin</i>.</p>

<p>The United States vessel took them to a convenient
harbor and left them there, for passage home via one of
the liners; but the war vessel returned to the Château de
Cadillac, accompanied by a French gunboat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>Of the resultant fate of the smugglers themselves, there
is no record; but of the <i>Shadow</i>, it is known that she was
raised from the bottom, where she was resting, and ultimately
delivered to her owner, who was a Russian prince,
for whom she had been built to order.</p>

<p>Bessie Harlan was restored to her friends, and the secret
of her mysterious trip abroad was never divulged.</p>

<p>And Monsieur Antoine Lafetre? And his beloved art?
He returned to America with Nick Carter and Maxwell
Kane, and is now a very successful fencing-master,
thanks to Nick’s patronage, whom the Frenchman seems
to regard as something more than human.</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr">Mon Dieu!</i>” he will exclaim when Nick Carter’s name
is mentioned. “Monsieur Carter is not a man, as you
or me. He is, what you say, a genius. He is a master
of the fence, and brave, ah! he is a wonder!”</p>

<p class="center">THE END.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">New Magnet</span>, No. 1230, entitled “Nick Carter’s Fall,”

<p class="center bold">NICK CARTER STORIES</p>

<p class="center larger bold">New Magnet Library</p>

<p class="center bold"><i>Not a Dull Book in This List</i></p>

<p class="center bold">ALL BY NICHOLAS CARTER</p>

<p>Nick Carter stands for an interesting detective story. The fact
that the books in this line are so uniformly good is entirely due to
the work of a specialist. The man who wrote these stories produced
no other type of fiction. His mind was concentrated upon the creation
of new plots and situations in which his hero emerged triumphantly
from all sorts of troubles and landed the criminal just where
he should be—behind the bars.</p>

<p>The author of these stories knew more about writing detective stories
than any other single person.</p>

<p>Following is a list of the best Nick Carter stories. They have been
selected with extreme care, and we unhesitatingly recommend each of
them as being fully as interesting as any detective story between cloth
covers which sells at ten times the price.</p>

<p>If you do not know Nick Carter, buy a copy of any of the New
Magnet Library books, and get acquainted. He will surprise and delight
you.</p>

<p class="center larger bold">Select Library</p>

<p class="center bold"><i>Big, Popular Standards</i></p>

<p>This line is truly named. It is Select because each title in it has
been selected with great care from among hundreds of books by well-known
authors.</p>

<p>A glance over the following list will show the names of Mary J.
Holmes, Marie Corelli, Rider Haggard, “The Duchess,” R. D. Blackmore,
and translations of some of the more famous French authors,
like Victor Hugo and Alphonse Daudet.</p>

<p>If you are looking for books which will add to your knowledge of
literature, a complete set of the Select Library, which is so reasonably
priced, will do more for you than a like amount expended on
ordinary fiction between cloth covers.</p>

<p class="center larger">The Dealer</p>

<p class="noindent">who handles the STREET &amp; SMITH NOVELS
is a man worth patronizing. The fact that he
does handle our books proves that he has considered
the merits of paper-covered lines, and
has decided that the STREET &amp; SMITH
NOVELS are superior to all others.</p>

<p>He has looked into the question of the morality
of the paper-covered book, for instance, and
feels that he is perfectly safe in handing one of
our novels to any one, because he has our assurance
that nothing except clean, wholesome
literature finds its way into our lines.</p>

<p>Therefore, the STREET &amp; SMITH NOVEL
dealer is a careful and wise tradesman, and it
is fair to assume selects the other articles he
has for sale with the same degree of intelligence
as he does his paper-covered books.</p>

<p>Deal with the STREET &amp; SMITH NOVEL
dealer.</p>
